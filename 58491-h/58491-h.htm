<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER I.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">SNOWBOUND.</span></h2>
<p>The car, after hesitating several times as though
undecided what to do next, finally came to an
unmistakable stop. The rear wheels, although
equipped with heavy chains, spun around for a
moment and then they also stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as though we&rsquo;re stuck, Mike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words came from a boy in the front seat,
but they were lost to the driver in the roar of the
wind as it drove the blinding snow against the windows
of the sedan.</p>
<p>The speaker tried again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as though we&rsquo;re stuck, Mike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time he shouted at the top of his voice and
the driver turned his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stuck is right, begorra,&rdquo; he shouted back.
&ldquo;Sure and it&rsquo;s meself that&rsquo;s been expecting it fer
the last half hour, an&rsquo; how could ye expect inything
on wheels to git through sich drifts, I dunno.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about a shovel, Mike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question came from a second boy in the back
seat and it also was shouted with all the strength of
a sound pair of lungs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and I&rsquo;ve got a shovel, do yez expect to dig
all the way to Skowhegan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys, Bob and Jack Golden, were on
their way home from college for the Christmas holidays.
Unfortunately they had missed the train
which they should have taken at Boston, and the
only other one for the day would take them as far
as Waterville, nineteen miles from their home in
Skowhegan. Rather than wait over a day, they had
telegraphed to their father and he had sent his man,
Mike, to meet them.</p>
<p>The snow had begun to fall soon after they left
Portland and the storm had increased rapidly in violence
until, when they reached Waterville, at ten
o&rsquo;clock, two hours late, it had reached the proportions
of a blizzard. Mike had been dubious about
starting, declaring that they would never make it,
but the boys had laughed at his fears and, against
his better judgment, he had yielded to them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>During the first hour they made seven miles,
plowing through snow up to wheel hubs. And this
brings us to the point where our story opens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it won&rsquo;t be so bad as that,&rdquo; Bob said with
a laugh, as he opened the door and stepped out into
the storm. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the shovel, Mike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and it&rsquo;s under the back sate,&rdquo; Mike shouted,
as he too got out of the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have it quick, Jack,&rdquo; Bob called, as he
stuck his head in at the rear door. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s colder than
Greenland out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack quickly pulled the shovel from beneath the
seat and handed it to his brother, who at once
started making the snow fly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he shouted to Mike, who had gotten
back in the car, &ldquo;Back up and hit her hard and I
guess she&rsquo;ll go through. Don&rsquo;t think I ever saw
the snow come down so fast,&rdquo; he added, as he threw
the shovel back in and climbed in beside Mike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; he shouted joyfully, a moment
later, as the big car plowed its way through the
drift. &ldquo;All it needs is a little elbow grease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But his joy was short lived for in less than a
hundred rods they struck another drift and again
the car came to a standstill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My turn this time,&rdquo; Jack shouted, and was out
almost as soon as the car stopped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>This drift was deeper than the first one and it
took the boy all of fifteen minutes before he felt
that there was a chance for the car to win through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll strike Skowhegan some time next summer
at this rate,&rdquo; he laughed, as he stamped his feet on
the running board.</p>
<p>As before, the car went through, but in less than
a hundred feet they came to a halt for a third time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; Bob shouted, as the car came to a
stop. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never get through to-night, that&rsquo;s sure.
Suppose you turn around, Mike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of trying?&rdquo; Jack asked, before
Mike had time to reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d probably get stuck just as quick if we
tried to go back. I move we stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about it, Mike? Got plenty of gas?&rdquo;
Bob asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Filled her up in Waterville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I think Jack&rsquo;s suggestion is a good one.
By running the engine once in a while we can keep
plenty warm and they&rsquo;ll probably break out the road
early in the morning. What do you say Mike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an I gess yer right. If we can&rsquo;t go ayther
forninst nor behind I guess we&rsquo;d better stand still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good logic anyhow,&rdquo; Bob laughed, as he
climbed over the back of the seat and joined his
brother. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be as snug as a bug in a rug and
there&rsquo;s no danger of getting run into,&rdquo; he added, as
he curled up on the roomy seat and pulled a heavy
robe over himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not much need of traffic cops on this road tonight,&rdquo;
Jack shouted from the other corner of the
car.</p>
<p>Bob was just drifting off to sleep when, above
the shriek of the wind he heard a cry which brought
him sitting upright in an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear that, Jack?&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Listen:
there it is again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again came the cry in piercing tones now plainly
audible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like a girl,&rdquo; Bob cried, as he pushed open
the door and leaped out, closely followed by his
brother.</p>
<p>Breathlessly they listened for the call to be repeated,
but no sound save the howling of the wind
came to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way was it?&rdquo; Jack asked, straining his
ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t the least idea,&rdquo; Bob replied, as he waded
around to the front of the car.</p>
<p>By this time Mike had joined them and, after listening
a moment longer, Bob said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must have given out. Mike, you hunt
around to the right, and Jack you go back a bit and
I&rsquo;ll see what I can find up ahead here. It isn&rsquo;t likely
that she&rsquo;s down by the river. If you find her yell,&rdquo;
he shouted as they started off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>The wind was still blowing a gale and the sharp
particles of snow stung like so many needles as Bob
faced into the storm. It was so dark that he could
hardly see his hand before his face and the headlights
were of little use as the car had stopped at
an angle to the road. The snow came nearly to his
waist as he plowed his way through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t be very far off,&rdquo; he thought, as he
bent his head to the force of the wind. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
believe you could hear a steam whistle a hundred
feet away in this gale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had not gone more than thirty feet from the
car when his knee struck something and the next
second he was bending over a form, which was
nearly buried in the snow. Quickly he straightened
up and, putting his hands to his mouth trumpet
fashion, he gave a yell that would have done credit
to a Comanche Indian.</p>
<p>As he again stooped and lifted the girl in his arms
she gave a low moan which he barely caught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not dead at any rate,&rdquo; he muttered, as he
endeavored to start toward the car. But, although
the wind was now at his back, the snow was too
deep and he was unable to take a step. But help
was close at hand, as both Jack and Mike had heard
his cry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;Give her to me,&rdquo; ordered the big Irishman, as
he reached Bob&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;Now break trail an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s
meself that&rsquo;ll take her back,&rdquo; and he took the girl
in his strong arms as though she were but a feather.</p>
<p>The boys kicked their way back, making a fairly
decent path through the snow, and in a few minutes
they had her in the car. Mike at once started the
engine, as it was far from warm, while Bob wrapped
her in a heavy robe and began to chafe her hands.
The girl was not unconscious, as he could tell by the
appearance of her eyes, but she seemed numbed
with the cold.</p>
<p>Quickly the heat from the exhaust made itself
felt and soon the rich color of health began to steal
back into the pale cheeks. The chattering of her
teeth gradually grew less and finally a faint smile
lighted up her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope&mdash;I won&rsquo;t&mdash;shake&mdash;the car&mdash;to
pieces,&rdquo; she said, evidently trying hard to make her
voice heard above the howling of the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess she&rsquo;ll hold together: she&rsquo;s had a lots
bigger shaking up than this and came through all
right,&rdquo; Bob assured her with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, but this&mdash;robe&mdash;feels good,&rdquo; she declared.
&ldquo;It was so&mdash;cold out there&mdash;in the&mdash;snow, and&mdash;and
I thought I was&mdash;a goner.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>In a short time she was recovered sufficiently to
tell them her story. It seemed that she had spent
the evening at a neighbor&rsquo;s only a few rods from
her home. She had started for home soon after
eleven o&rsquo;clock, never for a moment doubting her
ability to find her way. But she had entirely underestimated
the fury of the storm and bewildered by
the blinding snow had lost the path. For nearly
two hours she had stumbled about in the deep snow
before Bob had found her.</p>
<p>She told them that her name was Mary Scott and
that she was sure that she had not gone far from
her home. She also informed them that she was
twenty years old and was a school teacher. The
boys in turn introduced themselves and Bob asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t your folks be out looking for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not likely. You see,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;my
father is a farmer and he goes to bed early and no
doubt they were all fast asleep before ten o&rsquo;clock,
so you see they won&rsquo;t miss me till morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was now nearly two o&rsquo;clock and after some further
talk they, one by one, capitulated to the sand
man, all except Mike, who forced himself to keep
awake in order to &ldquo;kape up steam,&rdquo; as he afterward
told them.</p>
<p>Day had come when Bob, the first of the three to
awake, opened his eyes. The storm had passed,
although a high wind was still blowing, sending the
light snow swirling in clouds about the car. But it
had lost much of its savage force and no longer
howled as it had during the night. His watch told
him that it was just past seven o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some storm,&rdquo; he said in a low voice to Mike
who just then started the engine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say that same, begorra,&rdquo; Mike declared.
&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s meself that niver seed a worser one
except a few that were bigger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s playing it safe all right,&rdquo; Bob laughed,
as he climbed over to the front seat. &ldquo;Here comes
some one,&rdquo; he announced an instant later, as he saw
the form of a man plowing his way through the
snow toward the car.</p>
<p>He threw open the door as the man came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t seed nothin&rsquo; of a gal, have ye?&rdquo; he asked,
and it was evident that he was much worried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure have,&rdquo; Bob replied quickly. &ldquo;Dug her out
of the snow last night,&rdquo; he added, and just then the
girl spoke for herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right Daddy, thanks to these folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God for that,&rdquo; the man breathed as he
stepped into the car and hugged the girl to his
breast. &ldquo;You see when I got up this mornin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
seed that you aren&rsquo;t home I sposed that you had
stayed all night at Lucy&rsquo;s but ter make sartain, I
&rsquo;phoned over an when Lucy said as how you had
set out fer home last night I jest thought as how
you&rsquo;d be frizzed fer sartain. Yer mother&rsquo;s nigh
crazy, an&rsquo; I must hustle back an&rsquo; let her know that
yer&rsquo;re all right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>He thanked them for what they had done, but
the boys cut him short telling him how glad they
were they had found her in time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My place&rsquo;s the second one on the left, and you
won&rsquo;t have ter wait morn a few minutes afore Jeb
Taylor comes along with the snow plow. He was
jest gittin hitched up as I come by,&rdquo; Mr. Scott explained,
as he stood with one foot on the running
board. &ldquo;Gess ye&rsquo;ll have ter move your car though
so&rsquo;es he can git by. Yer see Jeb he breaks out&rsquo;s fur
as the Waterville line an&rsquo; Josh Howland he goes up
tother way&rsquo;s fur as Hinkley. Josh he allays gits
started afore Jeb an&rsquo; I low as how he&rsquo;s half way up
that by now. But I must hump back an&rsquo; let the
missus know as how Mary&rsquo;s all right. If ye&rsquo;ll jest
drop her off as yer go by it&rsquo;ll save her gettin&rsquo; all
over snow again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys assured him that they would be glad to
do as he asked and after thanking them again he
started back.</p>
<p>By great good luck the car had stopped at a place
where, after a half hour&rsquo;s work with the shovel, they
were able to back the car out of the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they come,&rdquo; Jack shouted a moment later,
and looking up the road they saw the snow plow,
characteristic of Maine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>It was made of two huge logs fastened together
in the shape of a V and drawn by eight yoke of
oxen. A half dozen men and twice as many boys
accompanied it, and the boys at least evidently considered
it a great lark as their shouts of laughter
attested.</p>
<p>After the plow had passed came the task of shoveling
through the huge pile of snow heaped up by
the roadside. But finally this was accomplished and
they were off.</p>
<p>Mr. Scott was waiting for them as they reached
the farm house, and insisted that they stop for
breakfast, although to tell the truth, they did not
need a great deal of urging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s got a big batch o&rsquo; buckwheat cakes and
sassage all ready an I reckon as how ye&rsquo;ll have an
appetite as&rsquo;ll about fit &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he declared, as he led
the way to the house.</p>
<p>They found Mrs. Scott a motherly woman who
showered them with thanks, and the breakfast was
all and more than the farmer had promised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll get home in time for Santa Claus
at any rate,&rdquo; said Bob.</p>
<p>It was several hours after they had said goodbye
to their new friends, and they were still several
miles from home. Three or four miles an hour was
about the best they had been able to make, for they
had been obliged to follow behind the slowly moving
plow nearly all the way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to make it by three o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; Bob
replied to Jack&rsquo;s guess. But it was nearer four
when finally they drove into the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were about to send out a relief expedition
for you,&rdquo; Mr. Golden laughed, as he welcomed
them home.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE LOST DEED.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is a serious matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was two days after Christmas and Mr. Golden
was talking to his two boys in the library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s over four hundred
acres of the finest timber in the state in that
tract. I bought it of Amos Town just ten years
ago, and he died about a year after. I had made
all arrangements to cut on it this winter and you can
imagine my surprise when, about a week ago, Ben
Donahue came into my office and told me that he
owned the tract. Said he had bought it of Town
about a month before he died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how about your deed?&rdquo; Bob interrupted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the strange part of it,&rdquo; Mr. Golden said.
&ldquo;Of course I went at once to the bank to get my
deed from my deposit box but to my great surprise
it was not there. Ben was with me when I opened
the box, and from the expression on his face when
I failed to find it, I was certain that he knew all the
time that it was not there, but of course I couldn&rsquo;t
prove anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the records in the Register of
Deeds&rsquo; office?&rdquo; Bob asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s another mystery. Of course that was my
next move, but when we looked it up, no record of
it could be found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you know that it was recorded don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly; but unfortunately that doesn&rsquo;t prove
it. You see, while the pages in the deed books are
numbered, they are of the loose leaf type; and my
theory is that someone has substituted a leaf for
the one on which that deed was recorded. Of
course Ben&rsquo;s deed is a forgery, but to prove it is
another matter. I&rsquo;ve gotten out an injunction to
prevent his cutting on the tract this winter and he
has done the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you suppose the deed got out of
your deposit box?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t the faintest idea,&rdquo; Mr. Golden replied,
pacing slowly up and down the room. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he
added a moment later, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no use worrying
about it. Al is taking up a load of supplies tomorrow
and I suppose you&rsquo;re planning to go with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; both boys replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Ben Donahue, or Big Ben as he was known
through the state, had for many years been one of
the big lumber men of Somerset County. But,
although he had operated on a large scale, it was a
well known fact that he had never made much
money, and several times he had narrowly escaped
financial ruin. Physically a giant and a terrific
driver of men, his lack of education, together with
an inherent carelessness in the handling of his accounts,
was undoubtedly the cause of his financial
condition. Unscrupulous and hated by those who
worked for him, nevertheless his tremendous vitality
and dominant personality made him a powerful
factor in the lumber interests of the county.</p>
<p>The stars were still shining when, the following
morning, the two boys climbed aboard the big sled
drawn by four horses and driven by Al Higgins.
Al was a teamster of the old school. Seventy-five
years old, he looked and acted as though not a day
more than fifty. It was his proud boast that he had
never been sick a day in his life and had never had
a doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon it be the Maine air,&rdquo; was his uniform
reply when asked for his secret of youthfulness.</p>
<p>It was a long two days&rsquo; trip to the lumber camp
on Moosehead Lake, hence the early start. The
mercury in the thermometer on the porch of the
Golden home registered twenty-two degrees below
zero as Al cracked his long whip over the ears of
the leaders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! We&rsquo;re off at last,&rdquo; Jack shouted, waving
his hand to his father who stood on the porch.
&ldquo;I believe that thermometer&rsquo;s got dropsy,&rdquo; he
laughed a few minutes later, as they drove across
the bridge which spans the Kennebec in the center
of the town. &ldquo;Why, it was colder than this in
Pennsylvania before we left and it never got below
ten above.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because the air is so dry here and so damp
there,&rdquo; Bob explained, as he pulled his cap down
over his ears. &ldquo;But you want to look out for your
nose. Remember it hasn&rsquo;t got any antifreeze in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh, who&rsquo;s afraid,&rdquo; Jack jeered. &ldquo;But this air
sure is wonderful, isn&rsquo;t it Al?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure said a mouthful: it&rsquo;s the greatest air
in the world,&rdquo; the old driver said, as he turned off
onto the lake road.</p>
<p>They had covered about three miles when the
first streaks of the coming dawn tinged the east.
Al had stopped the horses for a brief rest after a
hard pull up a steep hill when Jack, who, leaning
comfortably back against a bag of flour had fallen
into a doze, was rudely awakened by a handful of
snow dashed in his face followed by a vigorous rubbing
of his nose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey there, what&rsquo;s the idea?&rdquo; he sputtered, as he
tried to push the offending hand away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to disturb you old man, but your radiator
was congealed,&rdquo; Bob laughed as he continued the
rubbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I deny the allegation and can lick the alligator,&rdquo;
Jack gasped as he finally succeeded in freeing himself,
but after he had carefully felt of the tip of his
nose, he agreed that &lsquo;the alligator&rsquo; had acted well
within his rights.</p>
<p>Night was close at hand when they reached
Kingsbury, the half way station where they were
to stop at the little wayside hotel. It had been a
long day and soon after supper was over the boys
were in bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ll have to be rocked to sleep tonight,&rdquo;
Jack declared, as he pulled the blankets up
close under his chin.</p>
<p>Some time later Bob, who was a light sleeper,
was awakened by the sound of voices in the next
room. Two men were talking in low tones, but as
only a thin partition separated the two rooms and
the head of his bed as well as that in the other room
was close up against it, he could hear them sufficiently
well to be able to catch a word now and
then. At first he paid but slight attention beyond
wishing that they would keep still and let him go to
sleep. But suddenly he became keenly alert as he
heard one of them say in a tone louder than he had
used before:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;I tell ye it&rsquo;s risky.&rdquo; And the other replied impatiently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Risky nothing. There ain&rsquo;t a man round here
that&rsquo;d dare serve that injunction on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Big Ben,&rdquo; thought Bob, as he strained
his ears, but now the two men were talking only in
whispers and he was unable to catch any more of
the conversation. &ldquo;Guess Big Ben intends to cut
on that tract, injunction or no injunction,&rdquo; he
thought as he drifted off to sleep again.</p>
<p>At four o&rsquo;clock Al called the boys and they were
soon on their journey again.</p>
<p>Daylight found them several miles nearer the lake
and just as the town clock was striking twelve they
pulled into Greenville, a small town at the foot of
the lake. The camp was twenty miles up the lake,
a little to the north of Lilly Bay.</p>
<p>Bob had told Jack what he had heard in the night
and they both agreed that their father should know
of it. So they went at once into the general store
and soon had him on the long distance wire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Tom to keep his eyes open and let me know
if they start to cut,&rdquo; Mr. Golden said, after Bob had
told him what he had heard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Tom Bean was the foreman of the camp and a
great favorite with the boys, as indeed he was with
nearly all who knew him. An Irishman, quick of
temper but generous to a fault, and with a heart,
as Jack often said, &ldquo;as big as an ox,&rdquo; he possessed
the rare knack of getting the maximum amount of
work from his men with the minimum amount of
trouble. As one man put it, &ldquo;one worked for Tom
because he liked him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dinner over, they started up the lake on the ice.
A good road had been broken up the lake and they
made excellent time, reaching their destination fully
an hour before dark.</p>
<p>The camp comprised five buildings, all built of
unpeeled logs. In the center of the clearing was
the bunk house, a long low structure where the men
slept. It was heated by two immense wood-burning
stoves, while along both sides were the beds or
bunks built up in tiers three high. Back of the
bunk house was the cook and mess house, another
structure of about the same size but divided into
two sections. Two rough tables ran the entire length
of the larger section, while the smaller was a kitchen
or cook house as it was called. A little to the right
of the bunk house was a small building which served
as the office and sleeping quarters for the boss or
any other visitors. Six men could be accommodated
here very comfortably. The fourth building,
just behind the office, was the tool house, and back
of that a large shed for the horses. About sixty
men were at work at the camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; yer a sight fer sore eyes so ye be,&rdquo;
was Tom Bean&rsquo;s greeting as they jumped from the
sled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s mighty glad we are to see you again
Tom,&rdquo; and his words were echoed by Jack as they
nearly shook his arms off. &ldquo;And how&rsquo;s things
going?&rdquo; Bob asked as they began to pull their dunnage
from the sled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; &rsquo;twas niver better. We&rsquo;re bound ter
make a record cut this winter if the luck holds out,&rdquo;
Tom declared. &ldquo;But where do you want ter slape?&rdquo;
he asked, picking up one of their bags.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the bunk house of course,&rdquo; both replied in
the same breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s meself that thought so.&rdquo; The foreman
grinned as he led the way.</p>
<p>As soon as Tom had assigned their bunks to
them, the boys started out on a tour of inspection
of the camp as they laughingly told Tom. Dusk
was falling and the men by twos and threes were
coming in from the forest. They were mostly
French Canadians, or Kanucks, as they were commonly
called. Big men, most of them, they looked
as Jack declared &ldquo;as hard as nails.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>The boys knew only two or three of the crew, as
they were mostly new men that winter. They were
dressed in much the same garb as were the workmen&mdash;a
rough mackinaw coat, heavy khaki breeches,
thick woolen stockings rolled just below the knees,
and moccasins. It was characteristic of them that,
&ldquo;when in Rome they lived as did the Romans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were back of the cook house and were about
to return to the front of the camp, when two men
came toward them from the deep woods. The men
were talking earnestly together and paid no attention
to the boys as they passed them. At that
moment a small hunch-backed man came hurriedly
out of the back door of the cook house carrying in
his hands a pan of hot ashes. Accidentally he
bumped into one of the men, spilling some of the
ashes on his legs. With an oath the man gave him
a cuff on the side of the head which sent him
sprawling in the snow, the hot ashes flying over
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The big brute,&rdquo; Bob cried loudly enough for the
man to hear, as he sprang to the hunchback&rsquo;s aid
and pulled him to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What that you say?&rdquo; the man who had struck
the blow demanded, as he came close to Bob who
was brushing the ashes from the hunchback.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said you were a brute,&rdquo; Bob replied, looking
the man full in the eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;You dare call me name, I mak&rsquo; you eet them
word ver&rsquo; queek,&rdquo; and before Bob had time to defend
himself the Canadian swung an open handed
blow which caught him on the side of the face and
he too was sent reeling into a snowdrift.</p>
<p>Both of the men were laughing uproariously as
he picked himself up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you try that again,&rdquo; he said, as he
stood once more in front of the man.</p>
<p>Surprise showed in the Canadian&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;You
want more is et?&rdquo; he asked, as he drew back his
hand, this time closed into a knotty fist. &ldquo;All right,
I give you plenty dis time,&rdquo; and he struck with his
entire one hundred and eighty pounds behind the
blow.</p>
<p>But this time Bob was on his guard and as the
fist whizzed past his face he hit the man a stinging
blow just beneath the ear, which jerked his head
sideways but did not upset him. But it made him
mad and he came for Bob, as Jack afterward declared,
&ldquo;like a bull for a red rag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I keel you for dat,&rdquo; he shouted, and from the
look on his face Bob did not doubt but that he would
do it if he was able.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to spell able first,&rdquo; he said as he
dodged a vicious swing and succeeded in landing
again this time on the Canadian&rsquo;s nose. The blow
started the blood to flowing and as Bob had hoped,
rendered him insane with fury. If he knew anything
of the science of boxing, he threw his knowledge
to the winds as he again rushed, his fists beating
the air like flails.</p>
<p>The Canadian was several inches taller than Bob
and at least thirty pounds heavier and the boy well
knew that he was no match for him so far as mere
strength went, and that a blow from one of those
fists, delivered in the right place, would put an end
to the struggle in short order. But through long
practice he was a splendid boxer and he did not
intend to allow that blow to land. By this time a
number of the men, attracted by the cries of the
Canadian, had come up and were watching the
seemingly unequal contest with great interest.</p>
<p>As his antagonist rushed forward, Bob slowly
gave way, protecting himself from the hammering
blows as well as he was able. To be sure some of
them hit him, but they were only glancing blows,
thanks to his agility, and did no great amount of
damage. He knew that at the rate he was going
the man would soon wear himself out and he was
watching for the first indication of weakening. But
swinging an axe day after day, makes muscles
which do not easily tire and there seemed no limit
to the man&rsquo;s endurance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You no stan&rsquo; up and fight like man,&rdquo; he panted
as he missed a particularly vicious swing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;This suits me all right,&rdquo; Bob grinned. &ldquo;You
started this you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment Tom Bean came running up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut it out there, you Jean,&rdquo; he shouted, as soon
as he was near enough to see who it was with whom
he was fighting. As he spoke he sprang forward
but Jack caught hold of his arm and dragged him
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them alone,&rdquo; he begged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s Jean Larue,&rdquo; Tom gasped. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the
bully of the camp and as strong as an ox. He&rsquo;ll kill
the bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it,&rdquo; Jack returned. &ldquo;Look
there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom looked and could hardly believe his eyes
when he saw the bully of the camp, as he had
named him, stretched out at full length in the snow.</p>
<p>Bob had at last gotten his chance and had landed
full on his opponent&rsquo;s chin. But the blow, although
delivered with all his strength, lacked something
of the force which he was able to put behind his
right hand punch, owing to the insecure footing
offered by the snow, and the bully, although down,
was far from being out. He sprang quickly to his
feet but to Bob&rsquo;s disappointment did not rush at
him again. He had learned the futility of that kind
of fighting in the present instance and now he circled
warily around Bob seeking an opening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>It was growing dark rapidly now and becoming
more and more difficult to follow each other&rsquo;s
movements. Suddenly the Canadian sprang forward
and aimed a blow at Bob&rsquo;s head which he
barely dodged. But the force of the blow carried
the man slightly off his balance and before he had
time to recover Bob had again landed on the point
of the chin. Again the bully went down and all the
men shouted encouragement to Bob. It was evident
that the Canadian was not popular among his
fellows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>This time he did not get to his feet so quickly as
before and when he did it was evident that he was
somewhat dazed. And now Bob decided that the
time had come for him to force the fighting. So,
as the man got to his feet, he sprang forward and
aimed another blow for the chin. But he slipped
just as he struck and before he could recover himself
the Canadian had him around the waist. Bob
realized that there could be but one outcome to this
kind of fighting unless he finished it in short order.
To his joy he quickly discovered that the man
knew nothing of scientific wrestling, and in a moment
he had a half nelson about his neck and exerting
all his strength he threw him completely over
his head. The man gave vent to a heavy grunt as
he struck the snow and undoubtedly he was at that
moment the most surprised man in seven counties.
Once more anger got the best of him and, springing
to his feet, he came at Bob with much the same
tactics with which he had started the fight. This
was what Bob had hoped for and after defending
himself for a moment the right chance came. This
time he happened to have an excellent foothold and
the blow was not lacking in full power. Square on
the man&rsquo;s chin it landed and he dropped like a log,
and this time he did not get up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; yer&rsquo;er one broth of a bye,&rdquo; Tom Bean
shouted, as he rushed forward and grabbed the
panting boy in his arms. &ldquo;Are yez sure ye&rsquo;re not
hurt?&rdquo; he asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll need a piece of beef steak on this
eye, but I think that&rsquo;s about all the damage. But
he&rsquo;s sure got an ugly punch when it lands. The
only thing that saved me is that it didn&rsquo;t land
often,&rdquo; and Bob grinned as he took Tom&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>As the bully went down for the last time a loud
cheer went up from the crowd, which now included
practically the entire camp. No one went to his
assistance until Tom said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey you, Jim and Pete, rub some snow on his
face and git him into the bunk house. Sure an&rsquo;
he&rsquo;ll be all right in a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; he had it coming to him all right,&rdquo;
Tom declared, after Jack had told him how the fight
started. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hisself as is a mean one an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s bullied
the hull camp, but begorra, his bullying days
are over, for onest a bully is licked an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s done.
But don&rsquo;t fergit lad, ye&rsquo;ve made an inemy and ye
want ter kape yer eyes peeled mighty sharp so ye
does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if he had made an enemy of Jean Larue he
had also made a friend of Jakie Semper, the hunchback.
Jakie was what is known as &ldquo;cook&rsquo;s helper.&rdquo;
He washed dishes, kept the cook house clean, waited
on the table, and did a thousand and one other
things about the place. His unfailing good nature
and readiness to grant favors made him a general
favorite about the camp. After the fight he regarded
Bob almost with reverence and would have
become his willing slave had he permitted it. Although
his body was deformed, the boys soon
learned that his mind was, as Jack put it, &ldquo;as bright
as a new dollar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the two boys entered the mess house a half
hour later, they were greeted with a ringing cheer,
and many hearty slaps on the back proved to Bob
that his victory was most popular with the crew.
The boys had asked Tom not to tell anyone that
their father owned the camp, as they wished to
associate with the men on as nearly an equal footing
as possible. To be sure two or three of the
crew knew them, as they had been in their father&rsquo;s
employ for some years, but at the boys&rsquo; request
Tom had &ldquo;put them wise.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>After supper the boys accompanied Tom to the
office where they told him about the disputed tract
and what Bob had heard in the hotel the night
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just where is that tract, Tom?&rdquo; Bob asked when
he had finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis jest below us, an&rsquo; &rsquo;tis sure the crame of the
pickings up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where is Big Ben&rsquo;s camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jest forninst the big tract, aboot three miles
down the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How big a camp is it?&rdquo; was Bob&rsquo;s next question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the same as this,&rdquo; Tom replied, as he
filled his pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said everything was going fine, didn&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; Bob asked, after a short pause during which
Tom got his pipe drawing to his satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I said thot same, an&rsquo; so it is up to the presint,
but I dunno,&rdquo; and the foreman had a worried
look about his eyes which Bob was quick to notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Tom?&rdquo; he asked anxiously,
for he knew that Tom did not worry about trifles.</p>
<p>Tom Bean did not reply for some time and then,
as Bob repeated his question, he told them a strange
tale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE GHOST.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis this way,&rdquo; the foreman began, as he shifted
his pipe to the other side of his mouth. &ldquo;Yer father
has a contract to deliver four million fate of spruce
to The Great Northern Star Company in Waterville,
on or before the twentieth of nixt May. We
got a good crew here an&rsquo; kin do the job all right if
things go well; but &rsquo;tis a man&rsquo;s size job let me tell
ye and if the logs ain&rsquo;t thar on the dot the contract&rsquo;s
busted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s worrying you,&rdquo; Bob declared
as Tom paused. &ldquo;Come out with it. Where&rsquo;s
the fly in the ointment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s no fly at all at all: it&rsquo;s a ghost,
that&rsquo;s what it is,&rdquo; and Bob&rsquo;s laugh died on his lips
as he noted the serious look on the foreman&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, ghost?&rdquo; Jack broke in as
Tom paused. &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no such animal,&rdquo; he
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe not: I dunno, but I saw it meself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When was it you saw it?&rdquo; Bob asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jest last night right on the edge of the woods
out thar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did anyone else see it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only old Ike, and I bribed him to kape it to
hisself. Of course I spect it&rsquo;s a trick of Big Ben
to scare our men away. He knows how super&mdash;super,
hang it all, what&rsquo;s thot word?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean superstitious,&rdquo; Bob supplied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thot&rsquo;s it, and if the men git a notion this camp&rsquo;s
haunted, it&rsquo;s likely they&rsquo;ll all up and git.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should Big Ben want to scare off our
men?&rdquo; Jack asked. &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he got enough of his
own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not thot at all at all, but he bid against
yer father on thot contract an&rsquo; lost out so I spect
he wants him ter lose it. Sure an&rsquo; &rsquo;tis jest like
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time was it when this ghost made its
appearance?&rdquo; Bob asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; &rsquo;twas jest after supper, but, thank
goodness, only me and Ike had come out of the
mess house. I made a dash fer it, but the blamed
thing jest up and vanished afore I got half way
to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did it look like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; it looked ter be about eight fate tall an&rsquo;
was all white an&rsquo; fire streaming from its two eyes.
It sure was a sight all right all right, so it was.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;But it didn&rsquo;t come tonight did it?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, an&rsquo; I been kaping me eyes on the winder
thar. Yer can see the place where it was from
here. We&rsquo;ll kape an eye open an&rsquo; watch fer a bit
and mebby we&rsquo;ll see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, although they watched until after nine
o&rsquo;clock, the ghost did not put in an appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s of no use to watch iny longer,&rdquo;
Tom said, as he knocked the ashes from his pipe.
&ldquo;Unless it&rsquo;s a rale ghost he knows as how all the
byes are in bed by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither of the boys slept much that night. It
was not worry that kept them awake, however. It
was a far more tangible cause. In short it was snoring
on the part of many of the crew. The snoring
varied in tone, as Jack declared the next morning,
&ldquo;all the way from low A to high C.&rdquo; But as they
had had the same experience a number of times before,
they knew that they would soon get used
to it.</p>
<p>Jean Larue had not been at supper the night of
the fight, but he was on hand for breakfast the next
morning, apparently none the worse for his beating.
He had, however, a decidedly downcast look, as
though he realized, as no doubt he did, that the day
of his authority over his mates was past.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;If looks could kill, you&rsquo;d be a dead man,&rdquo; Jack
whispered to Bob as they took their seats at the long
table. &ldquo;That Larue is certainly looking daggers at
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so he doesn&rsquo;t do anything except look I
should worry,&rdquo; Bob grinned, as he helped himself
to a couple of shredded wheat biscuits.</p>
<p>The camp was situated about a hundred rods
from the lake and, at the time, they were felling
the spruce some two hundred rods north of the
camp. It was a sight which they never tired of,
watching to see the mighty monarchs of the woods
yield little by little at first to the axe and saw, and
then, with a terrific crash, fall to earth. Then
would come the trimming off of the branches and
sawing into the proper length, after which the logs
would be rolled onto the low but exceedingly strong
sleds and drawn by a span of horses to the lake.
There they were piled on the shore as closely as possible
to the water and were ready to be towed across
the lake by steamers to the Kennebec River as soon
as the ice broke up in the spring. Formerly axes
were used exclusively in felling the trees, but lately
large cross cut saws have to a large extent superseded
them. At the Golden camp the men were
allowed to use either as they desired.</p>
<p>As Jean Larue was passing the office that morning
on his way to the cuttings, Tom Bean called
him in, and after he had closed the door, said not
unkindly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jean, that boy licked you last night in a fair
fight as ye well know, and mind now, I don&rsquo;t want
to be after hearing of him gettin&rsquo; hurted by accident,
so to speak, cause if I do it&rsquo;s meself thot&rsquo;ll
make ye prove yer innocence. Mind now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean stood in sulky silence while the boss was
speaking, and as he finished turned on his heel and
left the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s him thot&rsquo;s the ugly brute,&rdquo; the foreman
muttered, shaking his head.</p>
<p>The boys spent the day with the men getting acquainted,
and by night they were calling a good
part of them by their first names and they were
Bob and Jack to them all. It had not been an idle
day for them by any means, as they had worked
nearly as hard as any of the men, although they had
not exerted themselves for fear of lamed muscles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just got to lay that ghost if he shows up
again,&rdquo; Bob declared, as they were trudging back
in the rapidly falling dusk. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s apt to stampede
the whole works if the men once get a look at him.
Of course it&rsquo;s a put up job of Big Ben&rsquo;s but we&rsquo;ve
got to catch him with the goods in order to prove
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night Tom Bean and the two boys again
watched the window of the office but when nine
o&rsquo;clock came no ghost had appeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess either he&rsquo;s a periodic ghost and we
haven&rsquo;t got on to his periods or else he got discouraged
after his first appearance,&rdquo; Bob declared as he
stifled a yawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think a ten-inch gun would keep me
awake tonight let alone a few snores,&rdquo; Jack declared
as they were walking slowly back to the
bunk house.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s guess went for both of them, for they fell
asleep almost as soon as they struck their beds and
neither woke until the cook blew the rising horn at
six o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>After breakfast was over and most of the men
had left the mess room, Tom motioned to the boys
to follow him to the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; ter take a look through thot tract and
I thought mebby ye&rsquo;d keer to go along,&rdquo; he said, as
soon as he had closed the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sure would,&rdquo; both boys eagerly accepted
the invitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right thin: we&rsquo;ll wait a bit till the men have
gone to their work. I don&rsquo;t want them to know
thot there&rsquo;s inything in the air. Nothin&rsquo; hinders
the work so much as to have them fellers git an
idea into their heads thot something&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; ter
happen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>It was nearly eight o&rsquo;clock before Tom announced
that it was time to start. It was a bitter cold morning.
&ldquo;Twenty-eight below,&rdquo; Jack declared as he
looked at the thermometer hanging just outside
the office door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jest wait till it gits down to forty an thin ye
kin say as how it&rsquo;s cold round the edges,&rdquo; and the
boys laughed as Tom stood before them fanning
himself vigorously with his cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder you don&rsquo;t take off your mackinaw
and go in your shirt sleeves, Tom,&rdquo; Jack laughed
as he stooped to fasten the thongs of his snow-shoes.</p>
<p>The dry snow creaked as they started off. The
snow in the woods was about two feet deep and as
it was light their snow-shoes sank several inches
making what Tom called, &ldquo;heavy goin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was right here thot I saw thot critter the
ither night,&rdquo; he announced as he paused on the
edge of the clearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you look for tracks?&rdquo; Bob asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; thot would have bin of no use. Yer
see there&rsquo;s a spring about a hundred fate in the
woods an the byes go thar fer water so the snow
was all tracked up here,&rdquo; Tom explained as they
started on again.</p>
<p>Two or three inches of light snow had fallen during
the early part of the night so that no tracks were
visible as they pushed their way through the dense
forest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thot tract starts right here,&rdquo; Tom announced a
few minutes later as he stepped and pointed to a big
spruce, in the trunk of which a deep gash had been
cut. &ldquo;Thot cut marks the northwest boundry.
&lsquo;Ain&rsquo;t it a crame of a patch?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys readily agreed with him as they gazed
in rapt admiration at the mighty spruces which,
growing closely together, reached up, straight as
an arrow, to a lofty height.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the finest bit of spruce I iver saw an thot&rsquo;s
sayin&rsquo; sumpin&rsquo;. An&rsquo; there&rsquo;s four hundred acres of it
jest like thot,&rdquo; he added as he again led the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far from the tract is Ben&rsquo;s camp?&rdquo; Bob
asked as they trudged along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not morn fifty rods, but he&rsquo;s cuttin&rsquo; on the ither
side of his camp. He&rsquo;s got some mighty good
timber thar too, but it&rsquo;s not like this,&rdquo; Tom replied.</p>
<p>They made nearly a complete circuit of the four
hundred acre tract but found no evidence of any cutting
nor did they meet anyone. They got back to
camp just in time for dinner, with, as Jack declared,
&ldquo;some appetite.&rdquo; The afternoon was spent with
the crew and when quitting time came they both
were, as Bob declared, &ldquo;dead tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had nearly finished supper, when, suddenly
the door of the mess house burst open and a Frenchman
by the name of Devaux, stumbled into the
room. His face was bloodless and he was shaking
so that he could hardly stand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;Der devil, I see him!&rdquo; he gasped hoarsely, as he
leaned for support against one of the bunks.</p>
<p>Several of the men sprang to their feet and crowded
around him, all of them asking him questions at
the same time. Bob threw a quick glance at Tom
and he answered with a slow shake of the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out der by der woods,&rdquo; they heard the frightened
man reply to the questions which were being
hurled at him, and the men made a rush for the
door.</p>
<p>Tom and the boys followed as quickly as possible,
and as soon as they were outside, looked eagerly
toward the place which Tom had pointed out to them
that morning. But nothing unusual greeted their
eyes. There was no ghost visible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Devaux, he drink too much der hooch,&rdquo;
Bob heard one of the men say as they trooped back
into the building.</p>
<p>They found Devaux somewhat recovered but the
man was still trembling.</p>
<p>Tom went up to him and took hold of his arm.
&ldquo;Looky here, son, you been boozing.&rdquo; It was an
accusation and not a question, and the Frenchman
immediately straightened up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That one beeg lie,&rdquo; he said firmly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>That settled the matter in Tom&rsquo;s mind in so far
as the drinking was concerned. No man in the
outfit would dare to call Tom Bean a liar unless he
had a mighty good reason for it, and Tom was well
aware of the fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You smell breath, you no believe,&rdquo; the man
insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Devaux, yer word&rsquo;s all I want. If ye say
as how ye ain&rsquo;t touched any hooch, sure an&rsquo; thot settles
it, but,&rdquo; and he drew him to one side so that
no one should hear, &ldquo;take me advice an&rsquo; kape it ter
yerself about what yer thought yer sawed,&rdquo; and as
Devaux nodded his head in silent assent, he left the
room, motioning for the boys to follow him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He saw it all right,&rdquo; Tom declared, as soon as
they were by themselves in the office. &ldquo;But the
byes won&rsquo;t take much stock in it I gess, seeing as
how Devaux is a kind of a joke with &rsquo;em, but, byes,
we got ter git busy an&rsquo; put a stop ter thot thing or
there&rsquo;ll be the dickins ter pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go see if we can find any tracks,&rdquo; Jack
proposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll do thot same, but we&rsquo;d best wait
till after the men are aslape. &rsquo;Twon&rsquo;t do ter let &rsquo;em
know thot we&rsquo;re taking iny stock in what the lad
said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were quick to see the wisdom of his
statement and so they waited until ten o&rsquo;clock, Jack
deeply immersed in a book and the other two playing
checkers, a game of which they were both very
fond.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;I gess &rsquo;tis safe enough now,&rdquo; Tom declared, as
the clock on the wall struck the hour.</p>
<p>There was no moon, but the night was clear and
the stars, aided by the whiteness of the snow, gave
enough light for them to see some distance ahead
as they made their way to the place where Tom had
seen the &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; three nights before. Somewhat to
their surprise they found the snow unbroken save
for the tracks which they themselves had made that
morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis mighty strange, so it is.&rdquo; Tom Bean
rubbed his chin thoughtfully as he stood facing the
two boys. &ldquo;Do yer spose there might be sich a
thing after all?&rdquo; he asked slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom, you surprise me,&rdquo; Bob replied. &ldquo;Of course
there isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I dunno, but will yez tell me how inything
made of flesh an&rsquo; blood could git here an&rsquo; lave no
tracks at all at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve got to find out, and I have an
idea. Come back to the office and I&rsquo;ll tell you what
it is.&rdquo; And Bob started to lead the way back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this,&rdquo; he began, as soon as they were
once more seated in front of the hot stove. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to try and get a picture of that thing, whatever
it is. You can&rsquo;t photograph a ghost you know,&rdquo;
turning with a smile to Tom, &ldquo;and if I can do it
it&rsquo;ll settle that part of it anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;I get you,&rdquo; Jack spoke up. &ldquo;And right now&rsquo;s
the time to fix it up. You see, the show&rsquo;s over for
the night and there&rsquo;ll be no one hanging around, so
let&rsquo;s get busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the other things which they had brought
with them was a good camera and a supply of flashlight
cartridges. The latter for taking pictures of
animals at night. Tom seemed rather skeptical but
offered no objection as they set about putting their
plan into execution. It took them until nearly half
past eleven o&rsquo;clock before they had things arranged
to their liking, but when that time came the camera
was hidden in a nearby tree in such a way that,
although not likely to be discovered, the lens had a
good view of the space where the &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; was
scheduled to appear. Wires hidden beneath the
snow ran to the office and were so arranged that,
when connection was made, the current from six dry
cells would set off the flash powder and at the same
time open the lens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There now, I&rsquo;m going to watch here every night
till something happens,&rdquo; Bob declared, as he finished
connecting up the cells.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>It was nearly twelve o&rsquo;clock when they turned in
but in spite of the lateness of the hour it was long
before Bob slept. He well knew how much depended
on the success of his plan. If anything
should happen to cause a stampede among the men
it would mean the loss of the contract as it would
be practically impossible to get others to take their
places this late in the season. As he lay thinking
the matter over, he suddenly raised himself on one
elbow and listened.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE GHOST HAS ITS PICTURE TAKEN.</span></h2>
<p>Through the stillness of the night came a cry.
At first Bob thought it was a wildcat, but, as it was
repeated a moment later, he knew that he was mistaken.
No animal with which he was acquainted
ever made a sound like that. Beginning in a low
note, which sounded like the rumble of distant thunder,
it rose in pitch as it increased in volume until
its shrillness seemed to reach almost to the breaking
point, then it slowly died away in a wail indescribable
in its weirdness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;What in the name of goodness can it be,&rdquo; he
thought as he listened. Soon it came again and now
it sounded nearer. A slight sound of the movement
of bodies in the bunks told Bob that he was not the
only one who was listening, and a shudder of fear
permeated him. Not fear caused by the cry itself,
but fear of the effect it would have on the men.
None knew better than he the fickle nature of those
men, brought up as they had been, on the lore of
ghostly legends of the north country.</p>
<p>Six times the cry was repeated and each time it
seemed nearer, and now he knew that a good part
of the men were awake, although none of them
had gotten out of his bunk, fearing probably that
he would be called a coward by someone. There is
nothing which these hardy woodsmen so hate as a
taint of cowardice, and many a one has gone to his
death rather than refuse a dare.</p>
<p>For a long time Bob lay in his bunk and listened,
but after the sixth time the cry was not repeated,
and finally the cessation of the sound of movements
in the various bunks told him that most if not all of
the men had fallen asleep again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear it?&rdquo; Jack whispered to Bob, as
they were dressing the next morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, but don&rsquo;t say a word to anyone,&rdquo; Bob cautioned.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk it over with Tom later when
we&rsquo;re alone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>No mention of the matter was made at breakfast
table, but both boys were quick to sense an air of
uneasiness among the men, and later, as he caught
the eye of the foreman, the latter shook his head as
much as to say that he feared the outcome. All that
day Bob and Jack worked with the men, felling the
great spruces, but although they tried hard to
joke and laugh as usual with them, the Frenchmen,
almost to a man, lacked that joyous spontaneity
of spirit so characteristic of them when
everything was to their liking.</p>
<p>They had had no opportunity for more than a
word with Tom Bean, as he had left, immediately
after breakfast, for Greenville. He was back, however,
when they returned to camp, as dusk was beginning
to fall; and, standing in the doorway of the
office, he motioned for them to join him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Byes,&rdquo; he began, as soon as he had closed the
door, &ldquo;how did the men act the day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As though they were much worried,&rdquo; Bob replied.
&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t talk about it even among themselves
as far as I could see, but I know that some
of them at least are scared, although they are trying
hard not to show it. I reckon that howling last
night on top of Devaux&rsquo;s yarn has got their goat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s meself thot&rsquo;s afraid so,&rdquo; and Tom
rubbed his chin thoughtfully. &ldquo;Sumpin&rsquo;s got ter be
done and mighty sudd&rsquo;n too or we&rsquo;ll lose men thot&rsquo;s
sartin sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment a loud knock sounded on the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; the foreman shouted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>The door opened and a giant by the name of Baptist
Goulet, followed by two others, entered the
office. It was at once apparent that the men were
ill at ease as they stood just inside the doorway
holding their caps in nervous fingers and keeping
their eyes on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it, Baptist?&rdquo; Tom asked, after he
had waited for the man to speak.</p>
<p>Even then the spokesman, Baptist, hesitated. &ldquo;We&mdash;we
lak our time,&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
<p>Tom Bean showed no surprise. It was what he
had expected, though not quite so soon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye mane yer want to quit?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oui, we queet,&rdquo; the man said, and the others
nodded assent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; the foreman demanded. &ldquo;Grub
no good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grub, she ver&rsquo; bon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Work too hard? Wages too small?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the man shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Work no hard, pay, she ver&rsquo; bon, but camp, she
got haunt. Devaux, him see it. We hear eet las&rsquo;
night. Stay here mebby all die ver&rsquo; queek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the man finished speaking Tom burst out in
violent laughter, though it was evident to the boys
that he was forcing it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s three old wimin ye are, to be scared
away from a good job by a bit of noise. Thar&rsquo;s no
haunt here at all an&rsquo; we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; ter prove it. Now
listen ter me. I&rsquo;m a goin&rsquo; ter make a spache tonight
at suppertime, an&rsquo; if yer want yer time after thot
come ter me an&rsquo; ye&rsquo;ll git it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty plain thot idjet of a Devaux&rsquo;s
bin talking,&rdquo; he said as soon as the men had left the
office. &ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s a wonder ter me thot more of
&rsquo;em didn&rsquo;t come. I&rsquo;ve got ter make the spache of
me life tonight or thar&rsquo;ll be doin&rsquo;s afore morning,
I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most of the men had finished their supper
when Tom Bean rose from his seat at the head of
the table and pounded on his plate with his knife.
Instantly the talking stopped and he began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men, thar&rsquo;s bein&rsquo; some doin&rsquo;s round the camp
thot I know well is gettin&rsquo; under some o&rsquo; yer hides.
I know that Devaux saw sumpin last night cause I
saw it a few night ago, but it wasn&rsquo;t no ghost. It&rsquo;s
jest somebody tryin&rsquo; ter scare ye away,&rdquo; and he told
them all about the contract which Mr. Golden had
and how Big Ben Donahue was trying to prevent
him from completing it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you know dat no ghost, by gar?&rdquo; Baptist
asked from his seat near the farther end of the
table.</p>
<p>The foreman laughed. &ldquo;Did yez iver hear of
inyone takin&rsquo; a picture of a ghost?&rdquo; he asked, looking
about the table.</p>
<p>Evidently no one had, and after a moment&rsquo;s
pause he continued:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, thin, thot&rsquo;s jest what these boys are a
goin&rsquo; ter do. They&rsquo;ve rigged up a picture machine
an&rsquo; the nixt time thot ghost comes round it&rsquo;ll git its
picture took, an&rsquo; thot&rsquo;ll prove thot it ain&rsquo;t no ghost
at all. Fer why? Because first thar ain&rsquo;t no sech
animal, an&rsquo; second because if there was he&rsquo;d not
show in a picture, cause he rally ain&rsquo;t thar at all at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he finished it was evident that, although the
men were not entirely convinced, they were at least
somewhat easier in their minds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we hear cry of haunt las&rsquo; nicht, by gar,&rdquo;
declared a little Frenchman who sat at Tom&rsquo;s right.
&ldquo;What you tink of heem, heh?&rdquo; and without waiting
for an answer to the question, he went on. &ldquo;I
hear day cry many years ago way up north an&rsquo; een
less&rsquo;n week ten men die, oui, by gar, they all die,
they didn&rsquo;t go ver&rsquo; queek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find out who&rsquo;s makin&rsquo; thot noise all right,&rdquo;
he answered somewhat evasively; then as he saw
that they did not seem to respond to his words, he
added, &ldquo;Jest ye lave thot to me an&rsquo; the byes here an&rsquo;
if we don&rsquo;t put a end to it the nixt time it starts,
sure an&rsquo; ye kin all have yer time an&rsquo; welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begorra, an&rsquo; I had ter make it strong,&rdquo; Tom
told the boys as soon as they were back in the office.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; now it&rsquo;s up ter us ter make good, but it&rsquo;s meself
thot dunno how it&rsquo;s ter be did.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to find some way, but just now I&rsquo;m
hoping that his ghostship will show up to night.&rdquo;
Bob had hardly spoken when Jack grabbed him by
the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is! Look quick!&rdquo; he whispered, pointing
out of the window. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder that Devaux
was scared to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the dim light of the stars a most grewsome
apparition appeared to be executing some kind of a
dance in the spot where Tom had first seen it. Not
less than seven feet tall the body, which was but
dimly visible, was surmounted by an immense head
which stood out more distinctly than the rest of the
object. It closely resembled a human skull, and the
large cavities which served as eyes glowed with a
bright phosphorescent light. Not for an instant was
it still, and its long arms waved up and down as it
danced, while every now and then it would leap
several feet into the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a peach all right,&rdquo; Bob declared, as he
touched together two pieces of wire.</p>
<p>Instantly there was a blinding flash just back of
the &ldquo;ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on now, make it snappy!&rdquo; Bob shouted,
as he sprang for the door.</p>
<p>Tom and Jack followed on his heels but, quick
as they were, every vestige of the &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; had vanished
by the time they were outside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; what do yez know about thot?&rdquo; Tom
asked a moment later, as they searched in vain for
tracks all about the place where the apparition had
appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll bet we&rsquo;ve got a good picture anyhow,&rdquo;
Bob said as he took the camera from its hiding
place. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll warrant his ghostship wasn&rsquo;t quick
enough to fool the lens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time most of the men were out in the
clearing, having seen the flash. They were standing
in groups talking excitedly but in low tones. Baptist
met Bob as he carried the camera back to the
office, where he had all arrangements made for
quickly developing the plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You no geet dat ghost, heh?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but you bet I&rsquo;ve got his picture here,&rdquo; Bob
assured him. &ldquo;You just wait ten minutes and I&rsquo;ll
show it to you,&rdquo; and followed by Jack he rushed
into the office while the foreman remained outside
talking with some of the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we didn&rsquo;t hit it it&rsquo;s all over but the shouting,&rdquo;
Bob declared as he dipped the film into the hypo
solution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right there, they&rsquo;d never wait to
give us another chance,&rdquo; Jack agreed as he anxiously
watched the film.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! We&rsquo;ve got it all right,&rdquo; he shouted a
moment later, as Bob held the film up for inspection,
&ldquo;and it&rsquo;s a dandy too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without waiting for it to dry, they rushed out
and in another moment were displaying the result
of their effort to Tom and Baptist, who, at the
moment, happened to be talking together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oui, by gar, you geet heem all reichte,&rdquo; the latter
declared as he held up the film for others to see.</p>
<p>The picture went far in restoring the confidence
of the crew, but Tom and the boys well knew that
the remembrance of that weird cry in the night had
by no means left their minds.</p>
<p>It was some two hours later when Tom and the
boys were once more in the office discussing the
situation. They had passed the interval with the
men in the bunk house trying to get them in better
spirits. Bob had taken out his guitar and led them
in singing as he often did, but it was easy to see
that the hearts of the men were not in the songs.
There was still a strain and the very air of the room
seemed laden with uncertainty. Earlier than usual
the men began, one by one, to slip into their bunks
and by eight-thirty only a half dozen were sitting
about the stoves. Earlier in the evening Tom had
made another short speech in which he told them
that in case they heard the cry again they were not
to be alarmed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;Me an&rsquo; the byes are sure a goin&rsquo; ter find out
what made it afore mornin&rsquo; and don&rsquo;t yer fergit it,&rdquo;
he assured them.</p>
<p>He would have called for volunteers but he well
knew that, although anyone of them would risk his
life for a much less reason against any physical
danger, it would be next to impossible to persuade
them to go far from the bunk house that night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s up to us,&rdquo; Bob declared, as he thrust
a stick into the stove and drew up his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re right me lad,&rdquo; Tom agreed, as he too sat
down. &ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; ye got a fine picture of the ghost
but yer can&rsquo;t take a picture of a yell so ye can&rsquo;t, bad
luck to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a few minutes there was silence, each being
busy with his own thoughts. Then suddenly Bob
stood up and, turning his back to Jack, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, will you kindly kick me good and hard
where you think it will do the most good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the main idea?&rdquo; Jack asked in a surprised
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The main idea,&rdquo; Bob replied, quickly turning
around, &ldquo;is that I&rsquo;m all kinds of a doughhead. Here
I&rsquo;ve been racking my brains, or rather the place
where they ought to be, for hours trying to figure
out how the ghost got there without leaving any
tracks, and it&rsquo;s as plain as the nose on your face.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hum&mdash;mighty complimentary to Tom and me.
Suppose you elucidate, my dear Holmes,&rdquo; and Jack
looked at his brother as though daring him to do
his worst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can show you better than I can tell you,&rdquo; Bob
said, as he grabbed up his cap and took a flashlight
from the desk. &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he called, as he threw
open the door, and they lost no time in following
him.</p>
<p>At either side of the place where the &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; had
appeared was a large spruce tree. As they reached
the spot Bob did not hesitate but, giving a leap, was
quickly among the branches of the tree to the right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come up here both of you,&rdquo; he called a minute
later, throwing the light from his flash down to
them.</p>
<p>Quickly Tom and Jack joined him, about fifteen
feet from the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now do you see?&rdquo; he asked, throwing the rays
about him.</p>
<p>In many places twigs had been broken from the
branches, evidence that someone had been there
before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And look at this,&rdquo; Bob continued, pointing to a
piece of string which had caught on a branch. &ldquo;And
here&rsquo;s a piece of cloth which tore off when he pulled
the ghost in,&rdquo; he declared, picking a bit of white
cheese cloth from where it had caught on a broken
stub. &ldquo;Do you know that fellow must have been
hiding right here all the time we were hunting
round down there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;Be jabbers, an&rsquo; yer right all right,&rdquo; Tom declared,
as he stared at the evidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did he get away?&rdquo; Jack asked, as
though certain that he had him stuck at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t hard,&rdquo; Bob replied. &ldquo;He just
waited here till we had all gone back and then he
crept along that limb to the next tree. You can see
that he could do it all right. Then he dropped into
that thick clump of bushes there and made off. I&rsquo;ll
bet we&rsquo;ll find his tracks there all right, you see if
we don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob was right, for when they had climbed down
and gone around to the other side of the bushes
there were tracks a plenty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think that we never thought of looking
here,&rdquo; Jack groaned as he gazed at footprints.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see he had that thing on a string which was
tied to that tree opposite and all he had to do to
make it dance was to pull on the string a bit and a
harder pull would make it bounce up higher in the
air. Then all he had to do when he wanted it to
disappear was to give a yank and break the string
near the other tree and pull it in. Of course he had
phosphorus smeared on the eyes,&rdquo; he explained, as
they made their way slowly back to the office.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;What time was it when that howling began last
night,&rdquo; Tom asked as he replenished the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just eleven o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; Bob replied. &ldquo;I looked at
my watch just before I heard it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thin it&rsquo;s mor&rsquo;n likely it&rsquo;ll begin about the same
time ternight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so. What&rsquo;s your plan, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well now,&rdquo; and Tom rubbed his chin reflectively.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not aisy ter tell the direction of a
noise like that in the night, but I&rsquo;m a thinkin&rsquo; it
came from the south all right an&rsquo; it warn&rsquo;t mor&rsquo;n
about a half a mile away when it started, so I don&rsquo;t
see iny other way but for us ter go out thar in the
woods an&rsquo; jest wait an&rsquo; trust ter luck. It&rsquo;s prutty
cold an&rsquo; it ain&rsquo;t a goin&rsquo; ter be no picnic, but I gess
we&rsquo;ll have ter be after doin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Bob agreed as he pulled
out the checker board and began to arrange the men.</p>
<p>They played until the clock told them that it was
half-past ten and then Tom announced that it was
time to start.</p>
<p>It was ten below and although the stars gave a
faint light in the clearing, as soon as they were
among the trees it was so dark that they could
hardly see a dozen feet ahead. They did not of
course dare to use their flashlights, for fear that the
man would be scared off and they did not want to
have to repeat the experience. There was no wind
and no sound, save the slight creaking of the snow
beneath their snow-shoes, to break the stillness of
the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we&rsquo;ve gone about far enough?&rdquo;
Bob whispered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ten minutes to eleven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gess so, but we&rsquo;ll have ter kape moving about
ter kape from frazing,&rdquo; Tom replied as he vigorously
swung his arms about his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freezing is right,&rdquo; repeated Jack, as he too
began to swing his arms. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cold enough to
freeze the hair off a bald man&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sis-s-h,&rdquo; Bob cautioned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so dark that fellow
might be within a few feet of us without us
seeing him, and if he hears us talking we&rsquo;ll likely
have this job to do all over again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some minutes after that no one spoke. They
kept moving about but did not separate more than
a few feet from each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time for the concert to begin,&rdquo; Bob
declared as he stepped close to Jack. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s five minutes
past eleven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Jack began, but stopped
suddenly as a low sighing sound as if the wind was
rustling the leaves of the trees came to their ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, I guess it&rsquo;s begun,&rdquo; Bob declared as he
turned his head slightly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Rapidly the sound increased in volume and in
pitch, and in spite of himself a shudder ran through
his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a peach all right, whoever he is,&rdquo; Jack
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s right over to the right of us an&rsquo;
not mor&rsquo;n three hundred fate away,&rdquo; Tom declared
as the cry ceased. &ldquo;Follow me now and make it
aisy,&rdquo; he ordered as he swung off to the right,
closely followed by the two boys.</p>
<p>They had gone but a few feet when the cry began
again, and now it was considerable nearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a comin&rsquo; this way,&rdquo; Tom whispered, as he
stopped in his tracks. &ldquo;Get behin&rsquo; thot big tree an&rsquo;
we&rsquo;ll wait fer him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem possible that a sound like that
could come from human lips,&rdquo; Bob whispered, as
they waited. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder that the man thought
it was the devil. There he goes again,&rdquo; as for the
third time the weird notes ran through the stillness
of the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s getting pretty close too,&rdquo; Jack whispered,
as he tried to pierce the darkness with his
eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Probably five minutes elapsed before the cry came
again, and they were beginning to fear that the man
had given it up for the night. But suddenly it began
again and now it was so near that they were
certain only a few feet separated them. Bob was
about to whisper to Tom, who was crouching directly
in front of him, when the Irishman, without warning,
let out a yell that so far as volume was concerned,
at least rivaled the other&rsquo;s cry. At the instant
he sprang forward and before the boys could
recover from their surprise he was swallowed up by
the darkness.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">TOM LAYS THE GHOST.</span></h2>
<p>Tom Bean&rsquo;s eyes, more used to the darkness than
those of the boys, had seen a dim form about ten
feet away and his impetuosity had brought forth the
yell and then he knew that not a moment was to be
lost. The &ldquo;devil&rdquo; breaking off his cry like the snapping
of a twig, gave one look and fled. But his
nemesis was close on his heels and as the toe of one
of Tom&rsquo;s snow-shoes came down on his heel, he
pitched forward sprawling in the deep snow. Instantly
Tom was upon him, and when the boys
caught up to them all that they could see was a
writhing mass of arms, snow-shoes and legs as the
two rolled over and over in the snow. It was so
dark they were unable to tell who was who and they
could do nothing except stand by and watch, but
they had little doubt as to the outcome. But as the
minutes passed and so far as they were able to see
neither had gained any advantage over the other,
they began to fear that at last Tom had met his
match.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to get into it,&rdquo; Bob declared, as he
stepped close to the struggling mass.</p>
<p>But at that moment the thrashing about ceased
and one of the men lifted his head. But which one
was it who was on top? Bob held his breath as he
leaned forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now kape quiet or I&rsquo;ll be after chocking the life
out of yez,&rdquo; and both boys gave a glad shout as
they recognized Tom&rsquo;s voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s a tough nut all right,&rdquo; the latter
declared, as he, panting for breath, got to his feet.</p>
<p>The other man evidently having lost all desire for
fighting, lay still in the snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up wid yez,&rdquo; Tom ordered, as he seized him by
the collar and slowly dragged him to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now ye dirty skunk what yer got ter say fer yerself?&rdquo;
he demanded, as he picked up his cap and
beat it against his leg to knock off the snow.</p>
<p>The man made no reply and Tom, rapidly losing
his patience, grabbed him by the arm and pulled
him around.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t ye got no tongue?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Ye
sure was makin&rsquo; good use of it a minute ago,&rdquo; he
added; and then, as the man still remained silent,
he again took hold of his arm. &ldquo;All right, mebby
the kitty&rsquo;s got yer tongue. Now ye come along wid
us an&rsquo; mind yer no funny business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the man hung back. &ldquo;Non, me no go,&rdquo; he
muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now by the saints, but ye will go and mighty
quick too, or I won&rsquo;t lave enough o&rsquo; ye to make a
good meal fer a wolf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But still the man refused to move. &ldquo;Me go back
camp. Me ver&rsquo; seek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sick is it?&rdquo; the Irishman shouted, his patience
now entirely gone. &ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s sumpin to make
yer sicker,&rdquo; and he struck the man a heavy blow on
the point of the chin.</p>
<p>He dropped to the snow like a log and lay still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad luck ter him,&rdquo; Tom said, as he looked down
at the fallen man. &ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; I hated ter do it, but
&rsquo;tis the only language they kin understand, so it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A handful of snow rubbed in his face quickly
brought him to, and with a groan he opened his
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me go,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s meself as knowed thot all the time,&rdquo;
Tom laughed, as he dragged the man to his feet.</p>
<p>Fortunately none of the snow-shoes had been
broken in the fight and after waiting a few minutes
for the man to recover his wind they started back.
No word was spoken until they reached the clearing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now take off yer snow-shoes,&rdquo; Tom ordered,
and as soon as the order was obeyed he led the way
back to the bunk house.</p>
<p>Most of the men were awake, some of them sitting
on the edge of their bunks, while others were
gathered about the stoves talking excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s yer howling spook,&rdquo; Tom shouted, as he
pushed open the door and pulled the frightened man
inside.</p>
<p>For an instant all was still as the men turned
their heads to see who had spoken, then as they
recognized the boss, a glad shout went up. After a
moment Tom held up his hand and the shouting
quickly died down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell &rsquo;em you made thot yelling,&rdquo; he ordered,
turning to his captive. &ldquo;Spake,&rdquo; he thundered, as
the man remained silent, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll be after giving ye
another taste o&rsquo; this,&rdquo; and he shook his huge fist in
the man&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>A sight of that fist was all that was needed to
loosen that man&rsquo;s tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me mak&rsquo; der noise,&rdquo; he said, in a tone trembling
with fear but loud enough for all to hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, we feex heem,&rdquo; one Frenchman
shouted, and a number sprang forward but Tom
waved them back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, byes, sure an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s had enough, an&rsquo; besides
he&rsquo;s only a tool,&rdquo; and, taking the man by the arm
he quickly pushed him out the door and closed it
behind him, after Bob and Jack had followed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now ye listen ter me,&rdquo; he began, as soon as
they reached the edge of the clearing where they
had left their snow-shoes. &ldquo;Go back ter yer camp
an&rsquo; tell Big Ben thot if he tries iny more of his
funny business we&rsquo;ll be after trying some too an&rsquo;
don&rsquo;t yer fergit it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Frenchman said nothing, but after fastening
his snow-shoes slunk off through the woods and
was almost immediately lost to sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s the last of the spook business,&rdquo;
Bob said thoughtfully, as they made their way back
to the bunk house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, but he&rsquo;ll try something else. Big Ben
doesn&rsquo;t give up so easily,&rdquo; Jack declared, and subsequent
events proved that he was right.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; having been laid, as Jack put it, the
boys were glad the next morning to note that the
men had fully recovered their spirits. Snatches of
song interspersed with frequent shouts of laughter
rang through the forest, as ax and saw bit into the
great trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re sure a happy lot when there&rsquo;s nothing
on their minds,&rdquo; Jack declared, as he buried the
blade of his ax in the trunk of a particularly large
spruce.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;ll only last,&rdquo; Bob returned, sitting down on
a log for a moment&rsquo;s rest.</p>
<p>Somewhat to their surprise Jean Larue had not
left the camp after his fight with Bob. The lot of
a dethroned bully in a lumber camp is not an enviable
one. Once lost, his power can seldom be regained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kape yer eyes on thot Larue,&rdquo; Tom had cautioned
Bob only that morning. &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t be
after staying on here after thot batin&rsquo; ye gave him
if he wan&rsquo;t up ter sumpin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess he&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Bob had replied
easily.</p>
<p>But now, as from his seat on the log he glanced
across the space from which the trees had been cut,
and saw the Frenchman staring at him, a look of
fierce hatred in his eyes, the foreman&rsquo;s warning
returned to his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I had better look out for that fellow,&rdquo;
he thought, as he slipped from the log and attacked
a large spruce. &ldquo;He certainly has it in for me if
he ever gets the chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When at noon time the loud blast of the dinner
horn rang through the woods, Bob had nearly finished
the felling of an extra large spruce. Fearing
that if he left it as it was the rising wind would
blow it over in the wrong direction, he decided to
finish it before leaving.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;You trot along and I&rsquo;ll be with you by the time
you get to eating,&rdquo; he said to Jack who had just
finished trimming a tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, make it snappy,&rdquo; Jack replied, as he followed
the last of the men leaving Bob making the
forest ring with the sound of his blows.</p>
<p>He had almost finished and the big spruce was
beginning to totter when, just as he drew back his
ax for what he thought would be the final stroke,
he felt rather than heard something whiz past his
head. Quickly he glanced up and there, sticking in
the trunk of the tree upon which he was at work was
an ax minus its helve. A cold chill ran down his
spine as he realized how narrowly it had missed
him. A quick glance behind him revealed Jean
Larue, standing about twenty feet away, and holding
in his hand a helve minus an ax.</p>
<p>Immediately the Frenchman came forward and
Bob could see that he was shaking, but whether
with fear or anger, he was uncertain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Head fly off ax. Wedge, she work loose, come
out,&rdquo; and he held out the helve for Bob to examine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I see,&rdquo; Bob replied, as he took the helve in
his hand. &ldquo;But how is it that you haven&rsquo;t gone to
dinner with the rest of the men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feenesh trim tree first,&rdquo; he replied uneasily.
&ldquo;I ver&rsquo; glad ax no heet boy,&rdquo; he added as he pulled
it from the trunk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, so am I,&rdquo; Bob returned dryly, as he
struck the final blow which sent the tree crashing to
the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You no tink I do eet purpose, heh?&rdquo; Jean asked
as he nervously shoved the helve back into the ax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let it go at that,&rdquo; Bob evaded the question.
&ldquo;But please see to it that nothing like that
happens again,&rdquo; he added as he started for the
camp. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want it to get to be a habit, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I drive wedge in ver&rsquo; hard thes time,&rdquo; Jean
promised, as he fell in behind Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go ahead,&rdquo; Bob ordered, stepping to one
side.</p>
<p>The Frenchman hesitated a moment, seemed
about to speak, then changed his mind, and without
a word struck off at a rapid gait toward the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a little too close for comfort,&rdquo; Bob
thought as he followed a few feet behind. &ldquo;Of
course it was no accident, but I hardly think he&rsquo;ll
dare try it again, but it&rsquo;s dead certain that I&rsquo;ve got
to keep a sharp lookout or he&rsquo;ll try something else.
If he&rsquo;d hit me I imagine he had it all planned to
light out, but when he missed he knew that he&rsquo;d
give himself away if he did, so he decided to face it
out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>By the time his thoughts had reached this point
he had struck the camp and making a hasty toilet
was soon at Jack&rsquo;s side eating with, as he told his
brother, &ldquo;a regular Maine woods appetite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get the tree down?&rdquo; Jack asked between
mouthfuls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure did, and if she don&rsquo;t scale 800 feet I miss
my guess,&rdquo; Bob replied, helping himself to a big
dish of baked beans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I see you coming in with Larue?&rdquo; Jack
asked a moment later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he waited to trim a tree.&rdquo; Bob had made
up his mind to say nothing even to Jack about the
&ldquo;accident,&rdquo; knowing that it would only worry him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a funny thing for Jean to do. Whence
his sudden inclination to extreme industry?&rdquo; and
the boy glanced suspiciously at the Frenchman who
was shoveling food into his mouth near the other
end of the table.</p>
<p>Bob made no reply and after a moment Jack
declared:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d known he was hanging behind you bet I&rsquo;d
have waited. I don&rsquo;t like it a little bit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>The next day was Sunday and the boys had
planned to spend the day with an old Indian friend
of theirs who lived alone in a little log cabin about
eight miles farther up the lake. The Indian&rsquo;s name
was Kernertok, meaning, &ldquo;he is black,&rdquo; and, as told
in a previous volume, the boys had on two occasions
saved his life. Naturally he was intensely fond of
them and they in turn thought that there was no one
quite like Kernertok. The Indian had taught them
much of woodcraft of which he was a master and
the boys never tired of listening to his stories of
the far north where he had spent his younger days.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful day, clear and cold as they set
off soon after daybreak. Their way led up the lake
for about seven miles, then in through the thick
forest for a trifle over a mile. The snow was fairly
well packed and their snow-shoes sank but slightly
making easy going.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, but it&rsquo;s great to be alive,&rdquo; Jack declared,
breathing in deep breaths of the spruce laden air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Particularly up here in the Maine woods,&rdquo; Bob
agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said a mouthful,&rdquo; Jack laughed, as he
stopped to tighten the thong of one of his shoes.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s another place in the world
that&rsquo;s so fine. Just taste that air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were out on the lake some distance from
the shore which, at this point curved sharply inward,
as the traveling was much easier than through
the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the old cabin,&rdquo; Bob said, after they had
made about three miles. &ldquo;Had we better go in and
see if everything is all right?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>The cabin referred to was one belonging to their
father and in, or rather, about which, they spent the
most of their time in summer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess we might as well,&rdquo; Jack replied. &ldquo;It
won&rsquo;t take but a few minutes and we&rsquo;ve got plenty
of time. You got the key?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, but wait a minute and I&rsquo;ll see. Yes,
here it is,&rdquo; as he pulled it from his pocket.</p>
<p>They headed in and in a few minutes were on the
porch of the cabin where they removed their snow-shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, but it seems colder in here than outside,&rdquo;
Jack declared, as he stepped inside. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to
come up some Saturday before we go back and stay
over Sunday. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say yes. We can keep a good fire going in
the fireplace and I guess we won&rsquo;t have any trouble
to keep warm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make it next Saturday, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righto, next Saturday it is,&rdquo; Bob agreed.</p>
<p>It was just nine o&rsquo;clock when they reached Kernertok&rsquo;s
cabin. They found the old Indian washing
his breakfast dishes and they knew that he was
overjoyed to see them, although his stoical nature
made it impossible for him to be demonstrative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Injun very glad see white boys,&rdquo; he said as he
took both their hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you bet we&rsquo;re tickled to death to see you,&rdquo;
Jack declared, and Bob&rsquo;s greeting was no less warm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>At the sound of their voices a large collie dragged
himself from beneath a bunk at one side of the
room, and the way he jumped at the boys striving
to lick their faces gave abundant evidence that the
dog also was overjoyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old Sicum,&rdquo; Jack declared, stroking the
dog&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t forgotten us, have you
boy?&rdquo; and a sharp bark of delight said as plainly
as words that he had not.</p>
<p>Bob had always insisted that no one could cook
like Kernertok, although Jack would never agree
that he could beat his brother when it came to baking
biscuits. However the dinner to which they
sat down a few hours later, consisting of trout
caught through the ice the day before, and hot biscuits,
to say nothing of the baked potatoes and
apple pie, left little to be desired.</p>
<p>It was shortly after three o&rsquo;clock when Bob,
glancing out of the little window, first noticed that
the sun was no longer visible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;d better be beating it back,&rdquo; he announced,
as he stepped to the door and threw it
open. &ldquo;Looks as though it might storm before
night,&rdquo; he said a moment later, as he came back
into the room.</p>
<p>At the words Kernertok knocked the ashes from
his pipe and went to the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;How about it, Kernertok?&rdquo; Bob asked, as he
came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look heap like storm. White boys better hurry
unless stay all night,&rdquo; the Indian replied, as he
threw more wood on the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could, but Tom&rsquo;ll be worried if we
don&rsquo;t get back so I guess we&rsquo;d better go,&rdquo; and they
started pulling on their mackinaws.</p>
<p>A brisk wind was blowing as they fastened on
their snow-shoes and bade their old friend goodbye,
after they had made him promise them that he
would meet them the following Saturday afternoon
at the cabin and spend the week end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t forget to bring Sicum,&rdquo; Jack called
back as they waved the old man goodbye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wind&rsquo;s coming from the northeast and unless
I miss my guess we&rsquo;re in for some snow before
we get very far,&rdquo; Bob prophesied as he cast an
anxious glance at the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; Jack agreed. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll
have it at our back as soon as we get out on the
lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed as though the wind increased with every
minute as they hurried through the thick woods,
and before they were half way to the lake a few
stray flakes began to sift their way down through
the trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to get it all right. Think we&rsquo;d
better go back?&rdquo; Bob asked, as a strong blast of
wind tore its way through the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nix on the going back stuff, as I&rsquo;ve often heard
you say,&rdquo; Jack replied with a light laugh. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
afraid of a little snow? We&rsquo;ll make it all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time they had reached the lake the storm
had set in in earnest and the snowflakes, driven
here and there by the gusts of wind, were coming
down with ever increasing rapidity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky we got the wind at our backs, I&rsquo;d sure
hate to have to face it very far,&rdquo; Jack said as they
started down the lake. &ldquo;This is going to be a
corker,&rdquo; he added a few minutes later, as driving
snow began to blot out the shore of the lake.</p>
<p>The walking rapidly grew harder as the freshly
fallen snow increased in depth, and before they had
covered a mile their shoes were sinking several
inches at each step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, hear that wind howl. It&rsquo;s enough to blow
the hair off a bald man&rsquo;s head,&rdquo; Jack declared as he
pulled his cap down farther over his ears. &ldquo;I sure
pity anyone who&rsquo;s coming up the lake tonight,&rdquo; he
added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d need it,&rdquo; Bob agreed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I
ever saw it snow so fast. I&rsquo;ll bet it&rsquo;s making an
inch in five minutes. We don&rsquo;t want to get too far
from the shore, and I think we&rsquo;d better turn in a
bit. If we lose sight of it and the wind should
change, we could get lost as easy as falling off a
log.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>They were hardly twenty feet from the shore at
the time, but so thick was the falling snow that it
was barely visible and they at once took Bob&rsquo;s advice
and it was not long before they realized the
wisdom of the move. Almost in a moment it
seemed the wind shifted and like sharp particles of
ice the snow was being driven against the side of
their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You spoke just in the nick of time,&rdquo; Jack
shouted, as he turned his head to the storm. &ldquo;Hope
it don&rsquo;t reverse entirely,&rdquo; he added a moment later.</p>
<p>By this time the going was very heavy and it is
doubtful if they were making much over a mile an
hour. Snow-shoeing on well packed snow through
the surface of which the shoe barely breaks is one
thing and an expert can travel at a rapid pace. But
when the snow is light and newly fallen and the
shoes sink deep and at every step the wearer has to
lift, not only the shoe but the snow which falls upon
it, the conditions are vastly different and progress is
very slow. The feet feel as though loaded with lead
and each step advances the traveler but a few inches.</p>
<p>Darkness was coming rapidly as Jack, who at
the moment was in the lead, stopped and turned
around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far do you think we&rsquo;ve come?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty hard to say,&rdquo; Bob replied, as he glanced
at his watch. &ldquo;It was four o&rsquo;clock when we struck
the lake and it&rsquo;s a quarter past five now. I&rsquo;d say not
over two miles or two miles and a half at the most.
We&rsquo;ve been creeping for the last half hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m mighty tired already,&rdquo; Jack said, as he
turned his back to the wind. &ldquo;I sure wish we&rsquo;d
accepted Kernertok&rsquo;s invitation and waited till
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it would have been better,&rdquo; Bob agreed,
&ldquo;but we must be pretty near half way down so I
suppose we might as well keep on as turn back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said anything about turning back?&rdquo; Jack
laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m worth a dozen dead men, so come
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On it is,&rdquo; Bob shouted, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s my turn to
break trail,&rdquo; and before Jack could object he had
pushed ahead of him. &ldquo;It seems as though the snow
keeps coming down faster and faster all the time,&rdquo;
he declared as he started off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and wouldn&rsquo;t I like to get hold of that fellow
that wrote the poem about the beautiful snow,&rdquo;
Jack growled, as he fell in close behind.</p>
<p>For another hour they struggled on without a
word being spoken. They both knew that they
needed to husband all their strength, and talking so
as to be heard above a Maine blizzard, takes breath.
It was now so dark that although he was scarcely
six feet behind, it was all Jack could do to see the
form of his brother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never make it,&rdquo; Bob declared, as he
stopped and waited for Jack to come close. &ldquo;But,
thank goodness, we must be nearly to the cabin and
we&rsquo;ll stop there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the words Jack let out a wild yell of joy.
&ldquo;And to think that I never thought of the cabin,&rdquo;
he said, adding: &ldquo;If we can only find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All we&rsquo;ve got to do is to follow down close to the
shore till we bump into the wharf,&rdquo; Bob said cheerfully,
as he started off once more. &ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo;
he shouted ten minutes later, and soon they were
removing their snow-shoes on the porch of the
cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I could have held out much
longer,&rdquo; Jack panted, as he followed Bob inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel exactly rested myself,&rdquo; Bob laughed.
&ldquo;Now if you&rsquo;ll get the fireplace going I&rsquo;ll do the
same by the range and we&rsquo;ll soon have the molecules
in here dancing about a little more lively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was plenty of wood piled under cover just
back of the cabin and soon the range was roaring
and the fireplace, as Jack declared, was doing its
best to hold up its end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That heat sure does feel good,&rdquo; the latter remarked,
as he held out his hands to the cheerful
warmth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>The cabin was well stocked with provisions and
it was not long before supper was on the table and
never did a meal taste better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This sure beats plugging through that storm
out there,&rdquo; Bob declared, as he listened to the howling
of the wind which showed no signs of abatement.</p>
<p>By the time they had the dishes washed and put
away the living room was good and warm and,
drawing their chairs up in front of the fireplace,
they were soon deeply interested in the books which
they had chosen from the well-filled bookcase.</p>
<p>Outside the wind still howled and drove the flying
snow against the windows with fierce energy, but
inside the cabin was warm and cozy. They had
been reading for the better part of two hours, stopping
only to replenish the fire as the logs burned
away, leaving a thick bed of glowing embers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Bob, who is the funniest writer you know
of?&rdquo; Jack asked, looking up from his book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;James Whitcomb Riley,&rdquo; Bob replied after a
moment&rsquo;s thought. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing, only you&rsquo;re wrong. He was
funny all right, but you see the man who wrote
this poem Snow Bound, which I&rsquo;ve been reading,
was &lsquo;Whittier.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>Bob caught up a sofa cushion and was about to
hurl it at his brother, when suddenly he paused,
holding the cushion in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>Slowly the hand holding the cushion dropped to
his side and both strained their ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; Jack asked, after a moment&rsquo;s
pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I heard a cry,&rdquo; Bob replied, still listening.
&ldquo;But I guess I was mistaken,&rdquo; he added,
as he picked up his book from the floor where it
had fallen.</p>
<p>But he had hardly started reading again when
he sprang to his feet and, rushing to the door, flung
it wide open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, I knew I heard something,&rdquo; he shouted,
as a faint but distinct cry reached their ears above
the wail of the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help, help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last time the call was barely audible and although
they listened intently it was not repeated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VI.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">COALS OF FIRE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone out there sure&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re alive,&rdquo;
Bob shouted as he closed the door. &ldquo;Come on,
we&rsquo;ve got to make it snappy,&rdquo; he said, as he began
to pull on his moccasins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who in the world can it be?&rdquo; Jack asked, as he
donned his mackinaw and pulled his cap well down
over his ears.</p>
<p>In another moment they were fastening their
snow-shoes on their feet on the porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s worse than when we came in if
such a thing is possible,&rdquo; Jack declared, shouting
at the top of his voice, in order to make himself
heard, as they started toward the lake.</p>
<p>And such seemed to be the case. It was impossible
to see more than a half dozen feet ahead and
the rays from their flashlights availed but little
against the thick cloud of falling snow. Every few
steps they paused to listen, but not a sound save the
roar of the wind and the creaking of the trees as
they bent their lofty tops to the strength of the
blasts, came to their ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;He must have given out,&rdquo; Bob shouted, as they
paused again at the end of the wharf, &ldquo;and unless
we find him mighty quick he&rsquo;ll be buried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can only do our best,&rdquo; Jack shouted
back, as he plunged forward, sinking nearly to his
knees in the light snow, despite his snow-shoes.</p>
<p>Until they were out on the lake, facing into the
storm, they had not realized the full strength of the
wind; but here, where it had a clear sweep, they
were hardly able to stand against it. But bending
low, they crept on inch by inch, the beating particles
of snow stinging their faces like so many
needles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse than looking for a needle in a hay
stack,&rdquo; Jack yelled as they again stopped to listen.
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;he can&rsquo;t be very far away or
we&rsquo;d never have heard him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe we&rsquo;re out far enough,&rdquo; Bob declared
a few minutes later. &ldquo;He could hardly have been
farther away than this. Suppose you circle round
to the right and I&rsquo;ll do the same to the left. Yell
if you find anything,&rdquo; he shouted, as he started off
at right angles to the course they had been pursuing.</p>
<p>It was perhaps ten minutes later that he was
brought to a sudden stop by the sound of his brother&rsquo;s
voice faintly piercing the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bob, I&rsquo;ve found him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a coming,&rdquo; he shouted, retracing his steps
as rapidly as possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;Keep calling,&rdquo; he added, bending his head to
avoid so far as possible the stinging snow.</p>
<p>Facing directly into the storm it seemed to the
boy that he would never reach his brother, but at
last he caught sight of him less than a dozen feet
ahead. Jack was on his knees in the snow holding
a man&rsquo;s head close against his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s pretty far gone, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; he shouted,
as Bob plowed his way to his side. &ldquo;He was entirely
covered with the snow and I&rsquo;d never have
found him if I hadn&rsquo;t stepped on him,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder he gave out,&rdquo; Bob declared a
moment later, as he took hold of the man&rsquo;s feet and
pulled them out of the snow. &ldquo;One of his snow-shoes
has given out and his foot has gone clean
through it. But we must get a move on and get
him to the cabin, if we can,&rdquo; he added doubtfully.</p>
<p>It was indeed a task to test the endurance of the
strongest. The man was large and heavy, but with
a prayer on their lips, they did not hesitate. Quickly
removing the man&rsquo;s snow-shoes, Bob fastened them
together by their thongs and slung them on his
back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;You take his feet and I&rsquo;ll lead,&rdquo; he ordered, as
he got his right arm under his shoulder pit. It was
all he could do to straighten up under the load, but
he managed it and they started. How they made
it neither could tell; but, as Bob afterward declared,
God must have given them the strength necessary.
Foot by foot they plowed through the deep snow,
sinking far down at every step, and obliged to stop
to rest every few minutes.</p>
<p>If the task was difficult while they were still on
the lake, it was doubly so when they reached the
shore. The cabin sat on a sharp rise about a hundred
feet from the lake, and it took them all of
half an hour to make that short distance. It was
literally inch by inch that they struggled on, praying
that their strength would hold. Not once since they
started had the man given the slightest indication
of life, and the thought that he might even now be
dead was discouraging. But, as Jack had declared
when they had started out, they had done their
best and they could leave the rest in the hands of
God.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>Finally, when their endurance seemed at the
breaking point, they struggled onto the porch, and
with what seemed his last ounce of strength, Bob
pushed open the door not waiting to remove his
snow-shoes. A good fire still burned in the fireplace
and dragging the heavy body onto the bear
skin directly in front of it, they quickly removed
their snow-shoes, after which they stood for some
moments leaning against the sides of the mantle
exposing their half-numbed bodies to the grateful
heat. But they both realized that this was a time
when minutes might well mean the difference between
life and death, and as soon as the first sign
of returning strength began to flow back into their
tired bodies, they sat to work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll make some strong coffee, Jack, I&rsquo;ll be
getting the blankets warm,&rdquo; Bob said, as he started
up the stairs. He returned almost immediately, his
arms full of thick woolen blankets which he draped
over the backs of chairs as near the fire as he dared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose whiskey or brandy is what he ought
to have,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;but we haven&rsquo;t got any of
either and I guess coffee is the next best thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The form on the bear skin was lying face down
and now Bob turned him over and, unbuttoning the
heavy mackinaw, he placed his ear on his chest.
For a moment he could detect no signs of life, but
just as he was about to give up, he moved his head
a trifle and his quick ear caught the faint sound of
heart beats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God, he&rsquo;s alive,&rdquo; he breathed as he lifted
his head and for the time glanced at the man&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Jean Larue,&rdquo; he gasped in surprise. &ldquo;If
that don&rsquo;t beat the Dutch,&rdquo; and he hurriedly ran to
the kitchen to tell Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well of all things, to think of an old stager like
that getting lost up here where he has lived all his
life,&rdquo; Jack declared as he poured out a cup of very
black coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was probably that broken snow-shoe,&rdquo; Bob
said, adding: &ldquo;Anyhow he&rsquo;s alive and we must get
him into bed as soon as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the work of but a minute to strip off the
man&rsquo;s outer clothes and wrapping him in the blankets
now thoroughly warmed, they lifted him to a
large couch, which they pulled as close to the fire
as they could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s see if we can get some of that coffee
into him,&rdquo; Bob said.</p>
<p>It was slow work but by dint of much perseverance
they managed to get a few spoonsful of the
liquid down his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better see if his hands or feet are frozen,&rdquo; Jack
suggested, as he pulled off one of his moccasins.
&ldquo;I guess they&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; he announced a moment
later, as he dropped the other one to the floor.
&ldquo;How about his hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all right. I think it&rsquo;s more exhaustion
than cold,&rdquo; Bob declared. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you
could freeze one of those Kanucks anyway,&rdquo; he
added as he raised the man&rsquo;s head again and told
Jack to see if he could get some more of the hot
coffee down him. &ldquo;His heart is getting stronger,&rdquo;
he announced a moment later, &ldquo;and he seems to be
breathing quite easily now. He&rsquo;ll be all right before
long, see if he isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; And his prediction was correct,
for in a few minutes the man gave vent to a
long moan and slowly opened his eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;Drink this,&rdquo; Bob ordered, as he raised his head
and held the cup to his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go Heaven, oui?&rdquo; the man whispered faintly,
as Bob laid his head back after he had swallowed
nearly a cupful of coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; Bob laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still on
the earth but you had a pretty narrow call all right.
Now you&rsquo;d better not talk any just now. Just rest
and we&rsquo;ll get you something to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes Bob had ready a steaming bowl
of oatmeal gruel which the man ate greedily and
strength seemed to almost rush back into his body
as the hot food warmed his stomach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you go to sleep,&rdquo; Bob ordered, when the
last of the gruel had disappeared. And it was not
many minutes before his deep breathing indicated
that he had obeyed the order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be all right now if he don&rsquo;t get pneumonia,
and I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s likely,&rdquo; Bob said as he laid
his hand on the man&rsquo;s forehead. &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t a
speck of fever so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was now after eleven o&rsquo;clock and they decided
that it would be safe to go to bed as Jean would
probably sleep for a long time if undisturbed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hear him if he wakes up,&rdquo; Bob assured his
brother, as they threw themselves in the bed in the
little bedroom which opened out of the living room.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky we&rsquo;ve got plenty of blankets,&rdquo; he muttered
sleepily, as he pulled them up around his neck.</p>
<p>During the night the storm blew itself out and
when soon after eight o&rsquo;clock Bob opened his eyes,
the sun was shining in at the window. Jack still
slept on and he got out of bed carefully so as not
to waken him. A good bed of coals still glowed in
the fireplace, and soon he had a roaring fire sending
a shower of sparks up the broad chimney. The
crackling of the fire woke Jean, and when Bob returned
to the living room after starting a fire in the
cook stove, he was sitting up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you feel?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feel ver&rsquo; goot, but ver&rsquo; hungry,&rdquo; was the reply,
as he got to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll remedy that last symptom in short
order,&rdquo; Bob laughed as he threw some more wood
on the fire.</p>
<p>Jack did not waken until breakfast was on the
table, then he came from the bedroom with a sheepish
look on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you let a fellow sleep all day?&rdquo; he
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, old man. You needed it and there
was nothing you could do,&rdquo; Bob assured him, giving
him a good hug.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>It was evident that Jean had nearly recovered
his strength and would soon be as good as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It takes a lot to kill one of those fellows,&rdquo; Bob
whispered to Jack as they were washing the dishes.</p>
<p>With a few strips of rawhide which Bob found,
Jean soon had the broken snow-shoe repaired temporarily
and by eleven o&rsquo;clock they were ready to
start for the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t told us how you came to get
lost,&rdquo; Bob said as he pulled on his mackinaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go Nor&rsquo;East Carry yes&rsquo;day mornin&rsquo;. Come
back, she ver&rsquo; hard goin&rsquo;, geet ver&rsquo; tired, then shoe
she bust, no can mak&rsquo; mooch go. See light in here,
then yell, then no more,&rdquo; Jean explained in his
broken English. &ldquo;You save life, me ver&rsquo; mooch
tank, no ought. Me no goot, trow ax on purpose,
ver&rsquo; sorry now. You no forgive, non?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surest thing you know, old man. Forget it.
We&rsquo;ll be great friends from now on. How about
it?&rdquo; and Bob held out his hand, a kindly smile on
his face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>The Frenchman had held his eyes steadily on the
floor as he stammered out the confession, and it
took some time for Bob&rsquo;s eager words of forgiveness
to penetrate his understanding. &ldquo;An eye for
an eye&rdquo; has always been his creed and he was slow
to grasp any other. But as he glanced up and saw
the outstretched hand and the smile which accompanied
it, the true meaning of forgiveness entered
his mind for the first time in all his life. Tears glistened
in his eyes as he grasped the proffered hand
and stammered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oui, we friends, you let me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, that&rsquo;s settled,&rdquo; Bob declared joyfully,
as Jack in turn held out his hand.</p>
<p>The going, though still heavy, was not so bad as
they had feared, as the wind had packed the snow
to some extent, and for the most of the way their
snow-shoes sank only three or four inches. They
reached the camp shortly after one o&rsquo;clock and were
received with shouts of joy by the crew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; we were jest after startin&rsquo; out ter look
fer yez,&rdquo; Tom Bean declared as he followed them
to the mess house, where, between mouthfuls, they
told him of their adventure. Not until Jean had
left them, declaring that he was all right and was
going to work, did Bob tell the foreman about his
conversation with the Frenchman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do yer think he meant it?&rdquo; Tom asked as he
finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it,&rdquo; Bob replied. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see that
Jean&rsquo;s a different man or I miss my guess. But
why all the gloom?&rdquo; he asked, as for the first time
he noted a worried look on Tom&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; the devil&rsquo;s ter pay,&rdquo; and the foreman
shook his head sadly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, shoot it,&rdquo; Jack demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hooch, so it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooch,&rdquo; repeated both boys in the same breath.
&ldquo;Where are they getting it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s meself thot don&rsquo;t know thot same,
but six or seven of them were drunk last night and
it&rsquo;s sick men they are this day,&rdquo; and again he shook
his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nadin&rsquo; ivery man we&rsquo;ve got it is ter
fill thot contract.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet it&rsquo;s some more of Big Ben&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; Jack
declared as he got up from the table. &ldquo;Anyhow
we&rsquo;ve got to find out where they are getting it and
put a stop to it. Do you know when they got it?&rdquo;
he asked, turning to Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must a bin some time yes&rsquo;day afternoon fer
they were all right at dinner time,&rdquo; Tom told him.</p>
<p>Fully three feet of snow had fallen during the
night and it took the crew all of that day to get the
tote road shoveled out and the snow cleared away
at the chopping. That meant the loss of a day so
far as getting the lumber out was concerned, and
the boys could see that Tom was much worried.</p>
<p>Until a late hour that night Tom and the boys
sat in the office discussing the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s evident that Ben doesn&rsquo;t intend to stop at
anything to keep Father from filling that contract,&rdquo;
Bob declared. &ldquo;But why do you suppose he is so
anxious to do it? Is it just a matter of spite?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, at all. Yer see if yer father falls
down on thot contract, then Ben thinks he&rsquo;ll be
dead sure ter land it nixt year,&rdquo; Tom explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, and there are so many ways that he can
put a spoke in our wheel that we&rsquo;ve got to be
mighty sharp to get the better of him,&rdquo; and Bob
gave Jack a glance which told him that it was up
to them to do it.</p>
<p>The stars were still shining the next morning
when the two boys crept quietly from their bunks
and groped their way to the door. Once outside
they quickly made their way to the office where
they kept their snow-shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than likely a wild goose chase but
we&rsquo;ve got to do something,&rdquo; Bob said as he took a
38 Winchester from the closet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what makes you think some one&rsquo;s coming
today?&rdquo; Jack asked as they were fastening their
snow-shoes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you. I didn&rsquo;t dare tell Tom for
fear he wouldn&rsquo;t let us go; but last night, just
before supper, I was out back of the cook house.
It was dark, of course, and I heard two of the men
talking only a few feet away but I couldn&rsquo;t see them.
I was hunting for my knife which I missed and
thought I knew just where I had dropped it, right
by that big spruce, the one where we were digging
gum just before dark you know. Well, I didn&rsquo;t
pay any attention to them till I heard one of them
say, &lsquo;He say he be out by big pine this morning.&rsquo;
That was all I heard, as they walked away then.
Now it may be something entirely different of
course, but I believe that someone is going to bring
some more of that stuff this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not tell Tom and try to catch him?&rdquo; Jack
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because that might make some of the men mad
and then they&rsquo;d up and quit. You know how fickle
they are. They want the stuff and we&rsquo;ve got to
keep them from getting it without letting them
know that we&rsquo;re doing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time they were ready to start and swinging
the rifle beneath his arm Bob led the way
toward Big Ben&rsquo;s camp. It was twenty below by
the thermometer on the office porch, but there was
no wind, and without wind the clear dry air of
Northern Maine is not penetrating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an idea that he&rsquo;ll start about daybreak
so we want to find a good hiding place before it
begins to get light,&rdquo; Bob said as they swung along
between the towering spruces.</p>
<p>The snow had settled enough to make good
snow-shoeing and they made good time although it
was still dark when Jack who was in the lead
stopped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re there,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;I can see a
light just a little ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in the cook house, I guess,&rdquo; Bob said, moving
a little to one side to get a better view. &ldquo;Yes,
that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; he added in a low voice, &ldquo;now to find a
good hiding place. Let&rsquo;s go over this way a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s just the place,&rdquo; Jack declared a few minutes
later, as he spied a thick clump of bushes in
between two large pines.</p>
<p>It was indeed an ideal place for their purpose
and just as the first hint of the coming day was
showing in the east, they crouched down in their
hiding place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope we don&rsquo;t have to wait long,&rdquo; Jack whispered,
&ldquo;because it&rsquo;s not exactly warm here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His hopes were realized for they had not been
there more than fifteen minutes when his sharp ears
caught the creaking of snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s coming,&rdquo; he whispered, and soon
they could see a man coming toward them. It was
now fairly light and as he came nearer they could
see that he carried a jug in one hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hit it all right,&rdquo; Jack whispered.</p>
<p>Just then the man caught sight of the tracks of
their snow-shoes and stopped as though undecided
what to do. But after a short pause he started off
again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Suddenly the sharp report of a rifle rang through
the forest and the jug smashed in pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly, if ever a man was scared it was that
fellow, and I nearly died trying not to laugh,&rdquo; Jack
afterward told Tom.</p>
<p>For an instant the man stood as if petrified; then,
with a wild yell, he turned and started back. In
his haste he tripped and fell headlong in the deep
snow. He was so scared that it took him some
little time to get on his feet again, but he finally
accomplished it and soon disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on now we&rsquo;ve got to beat it,&rdquo; Bob said,
as he crept out of the hiding place closely followed
by Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;ll try it that way again very
soon,&rdquo; Jack panted as they made the best time possible
toward home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where in the name of goodness yer been?&rdquo;
Tom was standing in the doorway of the office as
they returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just taking a morning stroll,&rdquo; Jack laughed.
&ldquo;Did you save any breakfast for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; I guess cookie&rsquo;ll give yer some, but I
thought sure ye&rsquo;d gone an&rsquo; got inter some kind o&rsquo;
fix agin, so I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they had finished telling him of their trip,
Tom laughed long and loudly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; who but ye&rsquo;d iver have thought of it?
I&rsquo;d give a year of me life ter have seen thot guy
when his jug went smash. Sure an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s meself
thot&rsquo;s bettin&rsquo; thot he thought the devil was after
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Six of the crew were nearly an hour late at work
that morning. Bob saw them crossing the clearing
as he was coming from the mess house after he
had finished his belated breakfast. Stepping back
into the room he watched them from the half-closed
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seem disappointed about something,&rdquo; he
said to Jack, who had joined him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess the party they were looking for failed
to materialize,&rdquo; Jack laughed as he watched them.
&ldquo;I wonder if those fellows could talk at all if their
hands were tied behind their backs,&rdquo; he added,
laughing at their vigorous gesticulations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would certainly be a serious handicap to
them,&rdquo; Bob declared, as he stepped outside the door.
Before Jack had time to follow him, however, he
dodged back again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for it,&rdquo; he said, closing the door. &ldquo;Who
do you suppose is making us a call?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From your excitement I should guess it&rsquo;s Big
Ben himself,&rdquo; Jack quickly replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right the first time. Now watch for fireworks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">BIG BEN MAKES A CALL.</span></h2>
<p>Big Ben Donahue was all that his name implied.
Standing a full six feet and four inches in
his moccasins, his broad shoulders and perfectly
proportioned body made him appear even taller. A
typical politician, his face, which habitually wore a
broad smile, could in a second, change to lines of
fierce determination. Although of Irish descent,
he was born in America and spoke without a
brogue. His strength was prodigious and he delighted
in such feats as tearing in two an entire
pack of playing cards, straightening out, with a
single jerk, a new horse shoe, and once, on a bet,
he had in eight hours, felled and trimmed three
thousand feet of spruce. One thousand feet is considered
a good day&rsquo;s work for an experienced chopper,
and the feat had never, so far as any one
around there knew, been duplicated. &ldquo;As strong as
Big Ben Donahue&rdquo; was a common expression in
Maine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad Tom had to go to Greenville,&rdquo; Jack
said, as glancing through the window he saw the
man making his way, with rapid strides, toward the
office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess we&rsquo;ll have to do the honors, but
be mighty careful what you say,&rdquo; Bob replied.</p>
<p>Big Ben, after hammering on the office door several
times without result, tried the latch but finding
that the door was locked he turned his steps toward
the mess house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got his company smile on anyhow,&rdquo; Jack
whispered, as the big man gave the door a resounding
whack with his big fist.</p>
<p>Bob threw open the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Donahue,&rdquo; he greeted the
guest pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning boys,&rdquo; and he held out his hand
with a broad smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; Bob invited, as he shook hands.</p>
<p>Big Ben followed them into the room and Bob
waved his hand toward a big rocking chair near
the stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty cold day even for Maine,&rdquo; he said
as Big Ben sat down making the chair creak with
his great weight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is that, but you don&rsquo;t mind it much in this
dry air,&rdquo; Big Ben said, holding out his hands to the
heat from the stove. &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he added
after a moment&rsquo;s pause, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He left for Greenville about half an hour ago,&rdquo;
Bob replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum, that&rsquo;s too bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if you wanted to see him,&rdquo; Bob returned.
&ldquo;Anything we can do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big man thought a moment as though undecided
what course to take. &ldquo;Well, I dunno,&rdquo; he
finally drawled. &ldquo;You see I kinder wanted to enter
a complaint like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A complaint! What do you mean? Have any
our men been bothering you?&rdquo; Bob put into his
voice all the surprise of which he was capable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kinder looks that way from the road, so to
speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean it. Please tell us about it.
I&rsquo;m sure that Tom would never stand for anything
of that sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;twas like this. Early this morning one
of my Frenchmen started for the spring for a jug
of water and when he was about half way there
some guy shot at him and busted the jug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible? Who do you suppose would
have done such a thing?&rdquo; and Bob succeeded in
bringing to his face a well simulated expression of
horror.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno, but I followed two sets of snow-shoe
tracks from just this side of my camp to here.
They were the only tracks I could find and it looks
mighty suspicious. What do you think? Of
course,&rdquo; he hastened to add, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care nothin&rsquo;
about the jug, but it scared the fellow so that he&rsquo;s
plumb afraid to stir out o&rsquo; the mess house and he&rsquo;s
talked so much about it that a lot of the rest of &rsquo;em
have got the fidgets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute, Mr. Donahue,&rdquo; Bob interrupted.
&ldquo;You say the man was going for water? I didn&rsquo;t
know there was a spring this side of your camp. I
thought you got your drinking water on the other
side of your camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Big Ben shifted a bit uneasily in his chair. He
realized that he had made a slight mistake and
hastened to correct it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we do, but that&rsquo;s what the fellow said he
was after. Perhaps he had found another spring
up this way somewhere, I dunno. Anyhow, that
don&rsquo;t make no difference, he was on my land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe there&rsquo;s some question in regard to
that,&rdquo; Bob declared hastily. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m not mistaken
Father&rsquo;s line runs pretty close to your camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so you&rsquo;d notice it it don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and the big man
got to his feet and the boys saw that the good-natured
look on his face had changed to one of
anger. &ldquo;That tract belongs to me,&rdquo; he roared, &ldquo;an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;ve got the papers to prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute, Mr. Donahue,&rdquo; Bob said in a perfectly
calm voice. &ldquo;There is no need to get excited
about it. That is a question for the court to
decide. But now that you have introduced the subject,
I&rsquo;m going to say a few things. Please sit
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big man, evidently realizing that he was not
showing to very good advantage in losing his
temper before a couple of boys, resumed his seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, trying to make his voice
sound calm, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hear what you have to say;
shoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks. Now in the first place you know as
well as we do that that man had liquor in that jug
and that he was coming up here to sell or give it
to some of our men. And it isn&rsquo;t the first time that
it has been done either. Now, wait a minute please,&rdquo;
as he was about to interrupt, &ldquo;let me finish and then
you can have your say. I shot that jug to pieces
and I claim that under the circumstances I had a
perfect right to; and I give you fair warning right
now that if it is tried again something worse may
happen than the loss of a jug. First you tried to
scare our men away with a fake ghost and then
you tried to get them drunk. It&rsquo;s of no use for
you to deny it,&rdquo; he added hastily, as he saw that
Big Ben was on the point of speaking. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m
done and will gladly listen to what you have to
say.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>While Bob had been speaking the big man had
been getting more and more red in the face, and it
was plain to both of the boys that he was having
all he could do to keep his temper under control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know that I could have you arrested
for assault?&rdquo; he asked, making a mighty effort to
keep his voice down to its natural key. &ldquo;How do
I know that you didn&rsquo;t intend to shoot the man instead
of the jug?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly you could,&rdquo; Bob replied calmly. &ldquo;But
just now it is a pretty serious thing to sell hooch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh, you&rsquo;ve got no evidence ag&rsquo;in me on that
score.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as may be.&rdquo; Bob was still perfectly
calm. A fact which seemed to exasperate the big
man almost to the limit of his will power. &ldquo;If you
think it best to have me arrested don&rsquo;t hesitate on
my account, but remember that I have a witness
that that jug contained something besides water,&rdquo;
Bob reminded him.</p>
<p>For some time Big Ben made no reply, then he
got slowly to his feet and leaned against the big
table facing the boys, and now his face had recovered
its friendly expression.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll let it go at that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And
as for that ghost business, that was only a bit of fun
on the part of some of the men. I didn&rsquo;t know
nothin&rsquo; about it till &rsquo;twas all over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suits us,&rdquo; Bob declared, as he too got up from
his chair. &ldquo;All we want is fair play. You let us
alone and we&rsquo;ll do the same by you. But we&rsquo;re not
going to sit still and have our work interrupted and
do nothing about it,&rdquo; he continued, in no way deceived
by Big Ben&rsquo;s smooth front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knew he was getting as good as he was sending
all right,&rdquo; Jack laughed as soon as their visitor
had taken his departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Bob returned, a worried look on his
face. &ldquo;But he means trouble and he&rsquo;s not the one
to give up when he once starts out to do a thing.
You know that as well as I do. Oh, he&rsquo;s a slick one
all right, but believe me he didn&rsquo;t pull any wool
over my eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor mine either,&rdquo; Jack declared hastily. &ldquo;It
won&rsquo;t be his fault if Father gets away with that
contract. But what do you think he&rsquo;ll try next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty hard to say. But come on, every tree
down helps just so much, and I feel like working
off some of my surplus anger with an ax,&rdquo; and Bob
led the way to the chopping.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>As Bob had predicted, a wonderful change had
taken place in the Frenchman, Jean Larue. His
overbearing attitude had disappeared entirely and
a spirit of genial goodfellowship had taken its place.
His companions, always generous to a fault, were
quick to notice the change and to throw all previous
hard feelings to the winds and accept him on
the new basis. Instead of being feared and hated,
he soon became one of the most popular men in the
crew. He eagerly sought the company of Bob and
Jack, and they gladly welcomed his company.</p>
<p>They were about half through supper that night
when Tom Bean returned from Greenville and, to
their great joy, Mr. Golden was with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought I&rsquo;d run up and see how things were
going,&rdquo; he explained as he greeted the boys. &ldquo;Tom
tells me that we&rsquo;re making good time so far and
that you are developing into first class choppers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as supper was over Mr. Golden, Tom
and the boys went at once to the office, and as soon
as they had the stove roaring in good shape, Jack
gave them an account of their morning visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty sorry to have trouble with Ben,&rdquo;
Mr. Golden said, when he had finished. &ldquo;The man
is a bad one to have as an enemy, but I hardly see
how it can be helped. It&rsquo;s the loss of that deed that
worries me most. As it stands now he&rsquo;s got the
law on his side, and unless I can find it it looks as
though I&rsquo;d have to lose the tract. That injunction
which I got out forbidding him to cut on it isn&rsquo;t
really worth the paper it&rsquo;s written on, and I imagine
he knows it, so if he starts cutting don&rsquo;t do anything
about it; we&rsquo;d only get into trouble and probably
not accomplish anything. If I ever find the deed
I can make him pay for all he cuts, and if not, well,
I guess the tract&rsquo;s his.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t yer have no witness when the deed
was made?&rdquo; Tom asked as he put a high chunk of
rock maple in the stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, but it happens that they&rsquo;re both
dead,&rdquo; Mr. Golden replied sadly. &ldquo;By the way,
boys, I received a letter this morning from Colonel
Break stating that they have had a fire at the Fortress
and college will not open for at least two
weeks later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah,&rdquo; Jack shouted, and then suddenly
stopped. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t really mean that,&rdquo; he said soberly.
&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m mighty sorry for the colonel
and all that, but just think of having two whole
weeks more up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they were about to separate for the night, Mr.
Golden told the boys that he had promised Edna,
their sister, that he would bring her some spruce
gum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to leave right after dinner in order to
catch the afternoon train, so you boys had better
take the forenoon and get it for me. You know
what Edna will say if I come home without it.&rdquo;
And he smiled as though it was something not
greatly to be feared but to be avoided if possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, sir, we&rsquo;ll get it,&rdquo; Bob said smiling.
&ldquo;I know where there&rsquo;s a dandy gum tree. I saw it
this morning and if I&rsquo;m any judge it&rsquo;s good for several
pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half hour after daylight, the next morning,
found the boys on their way toward Big Ben&rsquo;s
camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That tree is about a hundred yards this side of
where that Frenchman was standing when I shot
his jug,&rdquo; Bob said as they trudged along. &ldquo;I could
see big lumps of gum sticking out of the seam as
far up as I could see, and it looked like dandy
gum too. We&rsquo;ll get a lot of it and take some back
to college with us. I&rsquo;ll bet half of the boys never
chewed spruce gum or even heard of it for that
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The going was excellent and in a short time he
stopped at the foot of an immense spruce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; he announced, as he stopped to take
off his snow-shoes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll climb up first and you hand
the shoes to me,&rdquo; he proposed as he leaped for the
lowest branch. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the idea of leaving
them on the ground,&rdquo; he explained as Jack joined
him. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t put it past some of those fellows
to swipe &rsquo;em if they got the chance, and I feel safer
with &rsquo;em up here,&rdquo; and he carefully tied them to a
branch about twenty feet above the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Each had brought a small canvas bag and so plentiful
were the almost transparent lumps that in a
little over an hour both bags were nearly filled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best gumming I ever saw,&rdquo; Jack declared from
his perch well up near the top of the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you ever see such clear lumps?&rdquo; Bob
asked, as he shifted his position on a limb a bit
lower. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad we didn&rsquo;t bring a couple more
bags,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll fill our pockets. You
don&rsquo;t often get a chance like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For another hour they kept at it and had about
decided to call it quits, when Jack&rsquo;s quick ears
caught the sound of voices from below. He nudged
Bob&rsquo;s leg, which, at that moment, was hanging over
a limb directly over his head, and as the latter
turned, he put his finger to his lips.</p>
<p>As they listened the sound of voices came to them
more plainly. Two men were talking beneath a
tree a bit to the right of the one they were in, and
it was evident that they were making no effort to
moderate their tones, not dreaming that there was
anyone in the vicinity. They were not long in recognizing
the voice of Big Ben Donahue, but the
other man was a stranger to them. They were not
in the habit of eavesdropping but under the circumstances
they felt justified in listening. They soon
learned that the stranger was urging Big Ben to
begin cutting on the disputed tract and to Bob&rsquo;s surprise,
from what he had overheard that night in the
wayside hotel, the other was reluctant to take his
advice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know I told &rsquo;im that no one would dare to
serve that injunction on me, but that&rsquo;s not the
point. Suppose I go ahead and cut a lot of lumber
off of that tract and then that deed turns up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thunder an&rsquo; spikes! I thought you had the
deed,&rdquo; they heard the other reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I ain&rsquo;t. I found it in the booth in the
bank just after Golden had been in there and I put
it in my pocket, but there was a hole in it and when
I came to look for it, it wasn&rsquo;t there. It must a
dropped out and someone picked it up, so you see
how it is. I don&rsquo;t know where it is and it may
turn up any time and then I&rsquo;d be in a pretty pickle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure had a nerve to go ahead and get that
fake deed fixed up and all the rest when you didn&rsquo;t
have the deed,&rdquo; the stranger declared in a tone of
disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound it, man, I didn&rsquo;t miss the deed till
after I&rsquo;d done all that. Thought it was in my
pocket all the time. Oh, I know it&rsquo;s carelessness
about such things that&rsquo;s kept me from being a rich
man, but I can&rsquo;t seem to help it,&rdquo; and the man&rsquo;s
voice took on a sad note strange to its owner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>For nearly fifteen minutes longer the two men
continued to talk, but nothing more of interest to
the two boys was said, and soon they went back
toward the camp.</p>
<p>The boys waited till they were out of sight and
then quickly made their descent to the ground
retrieving their snow-shoes on the way down. If
they had made good time coming, they nearly flew
back so eager were they to impart the news to their
father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, you certainly must have struck it
thick,&rdquo; Mr. Golden said, as they burst into the
office, where he was talking to Tom, and threw the
bags of gum on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And gum was not the only thing we struck
either,&rdquo; Jack declared as he threw his mittens on
the table. And he told them what they had overheard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is good news indeed,&rdquo; Mr. Golden assured
them when he had finished. &ldquo;It may keep Ben
from cutting on the tract, but after all it don&rsquo;t help
us much unless we can find the deed. Of course,&rdquo;
he hastened to add, as he saw a look of disappointment
on Jack&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;we stand a good deal better
chance of finding it now that we know that Ben
hasn&rsquo;t got it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we do,&rdquo; Bob agreed. &ldquo;As he said, someone
must have picked it up, and, as it&rsquo;s no good to
him, he&rsquo;ll probably try to sell it to you or to Ben
if he learns what he&rsquo;s up to. It looks to me as
though the finder was just waiting to see what&rsquo;s the
best thing to do with it. If he was honest he&rsquo;d
have given it to you before this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, no doubt but that it has fallen into the
hands of some dishonest person,&rdquo; Mr. Golden agreed
soberly.</p>
<p>A good road had been broken on the ice through
from Greenville to North East Carry and it was
decided that directly after dinner Bob and Jack
would drive down with their father and bring the
team back the next morning. They reached the village
just as it was beginning to get dark and just
in time for Mr. Golden to catch the train for home.
The boys spent the night at the little hotel, and soon
after daylight the next morning started back up the
lake reaching the camp just in time for dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a friend o&rsquo; yourn in the office,&rdquo; Tom
sang out as they drove in to the clearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; Bob asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s Ezra, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s been after talking
so much potry ter me thot I didn&rsquo;t know whether I
was agoin&rsquo; or acomin&rsquo;,&rdquo; and Tom laughed as he
took the reins from Bob. &ldquo;You go see what he
wants an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll be after tindin ter the mare.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Ezra Kimball kept the one store at North East
Carry and was a character noted for miles around
for his habit of talking in rhyme. It seemed to be
not the slightest effort for him to find words to
rhyme and at the same time express his meaning
and it was seldom that he spoke in any other way.</p>
<p>Ezra was very fond of the two boys and they
had known him as long as they could remember.
He was sitting in front of the office stove as they
pushed open the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, so here ye are at last, beats all how
slow the time has past,&rdquo; was Ezra&rsquo;s greeting as he
got out of the chair and held out a hand to each.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty glad to see you, Ezra,&rdquo; Bob replied
heartily, while Jack declared that their visitor
looked younger every time he saw him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder, living in this Maine air, without a
trouble and without a care,&rdquo; and Ezra sat down
again just as the dinner horn blew. He quickly got
to his feet again sayin, &ldquo;Thar she blows and it sure
sounds good. Nothin&rsquo; I like better&rsquo;n lots of food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a little bit shaky on that last rhyme I&rsquo;m
afraid,&rdquo; Bob laughed as Ezra reached for his coon-skin
cap. &ldquo;Good and food may be spelled about
the same, but they don&rsquo;t hit it off worth a cent when
it comes to the sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ezra did not deign to take any notice of the
criticism. In fact he never attempted to defend any
of his rhymes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good enough fer me and if
the other feller don&rsquo;t like it he kin lump it,&rdquo; he once
told some one who found fault with his language.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>The boys well knew that it would be of no use
to try to find out the object of Ezra&rsquo;s call until
after he had eaten his dinner, so they quickly led
the way to the mess house. But as soon as they,
together with Tom, were back in the office, Ezra
lost no time in telling them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boys know a little feller, with a hump back
an&rsquo; face kinder yeller? Little squint eyes an&rsquo; big
thick lips, an&rsquo; mighty big when it comes ter hips?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Nip, sure as guns,&rdquo; both boys declared in a
single breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t say his name, or from whar he came, but
his tongue did wag cause he had a jag. He talked
&rsquo;bout everything under the sun, till I thought at last
he was almost done; when he said sumpin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout
havin&rsquo; found a deed, then he bought a great big lot
o&rsquo; feed; then he put on his snow-shoes an&rsquo; started
off, shapin&rsquo; his corse almost due north.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When was it he was there?&rdquo; Bob asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas yesterday he left the store, &rsquo;bout two
o&rsquo;clock or a little more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that all he said about the deed,&rdquo; Jack
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not another word did he say, though he jabbered
there almost all day. Ye see I didn&rsquo;t pay
much &rsquo;tention ter anything he happened ter mention,
but when Bill Smith came in ter feed, an&rsquo; said
yer dad had lost a deed, I thought that mebby the
one he&rsquo;d got was perhaps the one yer dad wanted
a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it was,&rdquo; Jack declared, as he threw
a stick of wood in the stove. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think so,
Bob and Tom?&rdquo; and he looked from one to the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure looks that way,&rdquo; Bob replied, and Tom
nodded assent. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he continued slowly, &ldquo;it
seems rather funny that he didn&rsquo;t try to make something
out of it. It don&rsquo;t seem like Nip to miss a
chance like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But further questioning caused Ezra to remember
that the man had said something about wanting
to get across the border as soon as he could and that
the deed would have to wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; Jack almost shouted. &ldquo;Nip had
been up to some of his tricks and had to make
tracks. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re right at that, and the chances
are that if he gets away with it, we&rsquo;ll never see him
or the deed again,&rdquo; Bob said, adding after a moment&rsquo;s
thought: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how much of a
woodsman he is, nor how much he knows about the
country up north; but, if he&rsquo;s got a good supply of
liquor, and he probably has, there&rsquo;s no knowing
what may happen to him. Jack, boy, we&rsquo;ve got to
go after him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;You said it,&rdquo; Jack shouted, springing to his feet.
&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go off half cocked,&rdquo; Bob cautioned laughing,
as he too got up. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get things
ready before we start on a trip of that kind. Don&rsquo;t
forget that it probably means sleeping out in the
open for a number of nights. He&rsquo;s got a day&rsquo;s
start of us and, although I don&rsquo;t imagine he&rsquo;ll travel
very fast, it&rsquo;s apt to take us several days to catch
up with him.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VIII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">ON THE TRAIL.</span></h2>
<p>After some discussion it was decided that they
would get everything ready and then drive back to
the Carry with Ezra and spend the night there, getting
an early start the next morning. Fortunately
Tom had a number of sleeping bags at the camp
and a toboggan about six feet long. On this they
packed their food and other necessities, knowing
that it would be easier to drag the load on the light
toboggan than to carry it on their backs.</p>
<p>The stars were still shining brightly in the heavens
when, the next morning, they waved goodbye
to Ezra and turned their faces to the frozen North.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get froze and don&rsquo;t get lost, or all the
gain&rsquo;ll be less&rsquo;n the cost,&rdquo; was Ezra&rsquo;s parting advice,
and they assured him that they would be careful.</p>
<p>From North East Carry to the Canadian border
is about fifty miles directly northwest, but at that
point is the main road to Quebec and small towns
are plentiful. Knowing this, the boys were not at
all surprised to find that the man&rsquo;s trail, which they
picked up almost at once, led more to the north.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nip&rsquo;s going to fight shy of the towns till he
gets across,&rdquo; Jack declared, pointing to the well-defined
trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks that way,&rdquo; Bob agreed. &ldquo;At any rate he
won&rsquo;t strike one the way he&rsquo;s heading till he gets
to the St. Lawrence River about a hundred miles
north of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trail was plainly marked, the prints of snow-shoes
showing clearly in the well packed snow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>They were hauling the toboggan tandem-wise and
hardly were aware of its weight. It was splendid
traveling, as there had been no snow for several
days and their snow-shoes made but little impression.
At eleven o&rsquo;clock they had reached the upper
end of the lake and decided to eat dinner before
striking into the dense woods which lined the edge.
They had made fast time but they well knew that
from now on their progress would be much slower.
Drawing a toboggan over the smooth surface of a
lake is quite a different matter from pulling it
through the thick forest where every foot of the
way must be chosen with care. They decided to
save time by eating a cold lunch, waiting until night
for their cooked meal, and in less than twenty minutes
they were on the trail once more.</p>
<p>While they were eating Bob had noticed for the
first time that the sun was no longer bright, and as
they entered the woods he called Jack&rsquo;s attention
to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m any good as a weather prophet we&rsquo;re
going to get some snow before night,&rdquo; he said as
he cast an anxious eye upward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can&rsquo;t be cured must be endured,&rdquo; Jack
quoted gaily, carefully picking his way between the
massive trees.</p>
<p>Not only were the trees very close together, but
the ground was uneven and it was, as Bob declared
&ldquo;all up hill and down dale.&rdquo; But it was no
new experience to them and they knew what to
expect, so for two hours or more they pushed forward
in good spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s heading a bit to the west of north,&rdquo; Bob
declared, as they stopped for a brief breathing spell.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it, as the farther he goes to the
west the farther he&rsquo;ll have to hike before he strikes
the border.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if he knows enough to keep a straight
course through the woods. A man&rsquo;s got to know
something about it to be able to do it, you know,&rdquo;
Jack declared, as he picked up the rope and started
off again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wind sounds like snow,&rdquo; Bob asserted, as
he fell in behind.</p>
<p>The wind, which for the last hour had been increasing
in strength, was coming from the northeast,
an almost certain forerunner of a storm at that
time of year. So well protected were they by the
thickness of the trees they hardly felt its force, but
they were too wise to be deceived by that, as the
sound, as it swept through the tops, told them that
it was already blowing a fair sized gale. And now
a few flakes began to sift lazily down through the
thick branches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a coming,&rdquo; Bob shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her come. We got here first,&rdquo; Jack
laughed back over his shoulder.</p>
<p>The flakes steadily increased in number and the
sighing of the treetops grew louder as they slowly
pushed on toward the north, and by the time
another hour had passed the trail had nearly vanished
beneath the falling snow. Only here and
there could they catch sight of the tracks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be all at sea as far as shoeprints are concerned
in another half hour,&rdquo; Jack declared, as he
anxiously scanned the snow ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>He was correct in his statement, for in less than
fifteen minutes the prints of the snow-shoes had disappeared
entirely, and now the skill which they
had acquired under the tutelage of their Indian
friend Kernertok, was brought into play. A
broken twig here, a bit of bark from a tree trunk
there, and other signs, readable only by one trained
in woodcraft, now had to serve as their only guide.
Their progress, slow from the time they had left
the lake, was now much slower, as they were often
obliged to search for some time before finding the
tell-tale clue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on a minute, Jack,&rdquo; Bob shouted a while
later. &ldquo;How long has it been since you saw any
marks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack stopped and looked around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s been quite a while,&rdquo; he confessed.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve been expecting to catch sight of one any
minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I haven&rsquo;t seen a thing since we saw where
he had leaned up against that big pine and that
must have been all of a quarter of a mile back. It&rsquo;s
going to begin to get dark in a mighty short time
now and I think we&rsquo;d better find a good place to
camp before we go any farther. I think I can find
the way back to that pine in the morning and we
can probably pick up the trail again from there if
we have any luck, but we&rsquo;re going it blind now,&rdquo;
and Bob cast an anxious glance about him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, you&rsquo;re the doctor,&rdquo; Jack agreed as
he threw the rope from his shoulders. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
matter with right here?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Those two
saplings will be all right for the canvass and that
big pine will make a pretty fair wind break.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As good as we&rsquo;ll be apt to find, I guess, if we
can only scare up some wood for the fire,&rdquo; Bob
agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right then, I&rsquo;ll do the digging if you&rsquo;ll hustle
the wood,&rdquo; Jack proposed, and taking a shovel from
the pack on the toboggan, he began work, while
Bob started off with the ax to see what he could
find in the way of fuel. Fortune favored him, for
before he had taken fifty steps he came upon a dead
pine which had blown over and was only partially
covered by the snow. He at once set to work hacking
off the brittle branches and throwing them in a
pile to one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough wood here to last a week,&rdquo; he thought,
as the pile grew larger with astonishing rapidity.</p>
<p>After a half hour&rsquo;s hard work he judged that he
had enough for the night and picking up as much
as he could carry he started back. Meanwhile Jack
had not been idle and by the time Bob returned with
the wood he had nearly finished a trench directly in
front of the big pine and extending between the
two saplings. The trench was about four feet wide
and nearly three times as long.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;Found some, did you?&rdquo; Jack asked as Bob appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. What did you think I went after? I see
you&rsquo;ve been pretty busy yourself and by the time
you get the house done I&rsquo;ll have plenty of wood
here,&rdquo; Bob declared as he started back for a second
load.</p>
<p>He made several trips while Jack was completing
his part, and when the latter finally stepped out of
the trench a large pile of dead branches as well as
a number of pieces of the trunk lay close by. The
two small trees stood about six feet from the big
pine, and to each of them they tied a corner of a
large strip of canvass, about three feet from the
surface of the snow. The other two corners they
fastened to sticks driven well down in the snow
close to the foot of the pine, so that about six feet
of the trench was covered with a sloping canvass
roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s get the fire going and then for a good
hot supper. That cold lunch didn&rsquo;t even fill up the
corners,&rdquo; Jack declared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>In the uncovered end of the trench, which was
nearly four feet deep, Bob started a small fire, while
Jack undid the pack enough to get out the cooking
utensils and the provisions. It was now nearly dark
and the bright light from the crackling fire cast fantastic
shadows as the boys moved about their work.
In a surprisingly short time a meal of bacon and
eggs, flapjacks and coffee was ready. Enough, as
Bob laughingly declared, &ldquo;to satisfy a dozen ordinary
men.&rdquo; But there is no better appetizer than
strenuous exercise in the clear cold spruce-laden
air of Northern Maine, and in spite of appearances
he found that Jack had used excellent judgment in
his estimation of the proper amount of food, for, as
he declared, after they had finished, &ldquo;not enough
remained to feed a good-sized mosquito.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After &ldquo;doing the dishes&rdquo; they brought in the rest
of the wood which Bob had cut and then turned
their attention to preparations for the night. Over
the ground beneath the canvass roof they spread a
thick layer of spruce boughs, covering them with a
thick woolen blanket, making a bed, as Jack declared,
&ldquo;fit for any king.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Then they pulled the toboggan close beneath
another large pine a few feet away, where it would
be protected as well as conditions would permit
from the storm, and covered the pack with a second
strip of canvass. Then, throwing an armful of the
dead branches on the fire, they waited until the
flames were shooting well above the snow walls of
the trench before piling on the larger pieces of the
trunk. These being of good size, would last for
several hours, and if they should fail to awake in
time to replenish the fire, they knew that the thick
sleeping bags would be ample protection from the
cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She don&rsquo;t seem to be letting up any,&rdquo; Jack
asserted as he listened to the wind now fairly howling
through the tops of the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said it,&rdquo; Bob agreed, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll bet it&rsquo;s snowing
an inch every fifteen minutes. Must be close
on to a foot already. If it keeps it up like this all
night, we&rsquo;ll have mighty hard going tomorrow let
me tell you,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So will Nip, and that&rsquo;s one comfort,&rdquo; Jack declared,
as he threw another log on the fire.</p>
<p>By eight o&rsquo;clock everything was &ldquo;shipshape,&rdquo; as
Bob put it, and crawling into the sleeping bags they
pulled a heavy army blanket over them and were
soon lulled to sleep by the sighing of the wind as
the lofty spruces and pines bent their tops to its
strength.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>It must have been well after midnight when suddenly
Bob awoke. The fire was about burned out,
only a glowing bed of embers remaining. For a
moment he lay wondering what had disturbed him.
The wind still blew with undiminished fury, but he
knew that some other sound had reached his ears.
He did not, however, have to wonder long, for suddenly
through the dense forest, above the wailing
of the wind, came a sound which sent a shudder
through his frame, for once before he had heard
that cry while on a hunting trip with his father in
Canada.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a timber wolf,&rdquo; he whispered to himself.
&ldquo;Never knew they came so far south as this, but it&rsquo;s
probably only a stray one,&rdquo; he thought as he turned
over and shut his eyes. But a moment later he was
brought to a sitting position as an answering howl
far off to the left answered the first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s two of them at any rate,&rdquo; he said half
aloud, as he gave Jack a shake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Jack grunted sleepily,
as he turned over and rubbed his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen a minute and you&rsquo;ll find out,&rdquo; Bob replied,
and even as he spoke another howl, this time
nearer and more to the right, came to their ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Jack asked, as he sat up, now fully
awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wolves and they&rsquo;re coming our way,&rdquo; Bob
replied, as he began to crawl out of his bag. &ldquo;We
must get that fire going again. They&rsquo;re afraid of
a fire, thank goodness, but that&rsquo;s about the only
thing they are afraid of.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>It was the work of but a minute to heap more
wood on the dying coals, and they were glad to find
that there was still enough fire left to catch the new
fuel. Soon the flames were shooting up once more,
but now the howls were coming with increasing frequency
and each one seemed nearer than the one
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good many more than one in that
pack,&rdquo; Bob declared as he jumped back into the
trench, and picked up the 38 Winchester, which he
had taken from the pack before going to bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say so,&rdquo; Jack agreed, as howl answered
to howl above the roaring of the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deep snow up north must have driven them
south,&rdquo; Bob declared as he listened to the short full-throated
cry of the hunting timber wolves now so
plainly heard through the wall of the falling snow
that he strained his eyes, expecting every minute to
catch sight of the leaping forms. Just then Jack
spoke and the note of alarm in his voice caused Bob
to turn his head quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My gracious, Bob, do you realize that we threw
on the last of the wood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, and there&rsquo;s not enough to keep the fire
going more than a half hour at most, and it&rsquo;s all of
six hours to daylight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think we&rsquo;d better climb a tree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Bob replied after a moment&rsquo;s thought.
&ldquo;That big pine&rsquo;s pretty handy and we can get into it
if we have to, but it&rsquo;d be mighty cold up there.
They won&rsquo;t dare to come very near so long as the
fire&rsquo;s going in good shape, and if I can pick off two
or three of them, perhaps they&rsquo;ll clear out. Just
hear them howl.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see one,&rdquo; Jack shouted a moment later, as a
gray form bounded into view not more than twenty
feet away.</p>
<p>His words were followed by the sharp crack of
the rifle and the wolf leaped high in the air with a
sharp yelp of pain and fell back. Almost instantly
the deep throated howls changed to sharp yelps and
snarls as the pack fought over the body of the dead
wolf. Bob quickly fired three more shots at the
writhing mass, which he could see but dimly
through the falling snow. Whether or not any of
the shots took effect he was unable to tell, as the
incessant yelping made it impossible to distinguish
any separate cry of pain.</p>
<p>For perhaps ten minutes the battle raged, then,
almost as suddenly as it had started, it was ended,
and the gray forms slunk back among the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t take &rsquo;em long to finish him,&rdquo; Jack declared,
as he gave the fire a poking causing it to
blaze up afresh. &ldquo;Think they&rsquo;ve quit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; Bob replied. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re pretty wise
fellows and they&rsquo;ve had a lesson; but if they&rsquo;re very
hungry, and I guess there&rsquo;s no doubt about that,
they won&rsquo;t give up so easy. If we only had plenty
of wood we&rsquo;d be all right,&rdquo; he added, giving the
fire another poke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>But now the wood was nearly all consumed and
the poking had but slight effect. The howls had
ceased entirely and had it not been for the occasional
glimpse of a shadowy form dimly seen in
the darkness, they might have concluded that the
wolves had given it up as a bad job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess they&rsquo;re waiting for the fire to go out,&rdquo;
Jack suggested as he again tried to coax a blaze
from the dying embers.</p>
<p>Bang! A shaggy form, more bold than the rest,
had crept forward until he offered a fair shot, but
he paid for his temerity with his life, and quickly
furnished material for a second cannibalistic feast.</p>
<p>Fortunately he had plenty of cartridges and he
again fired shot after shot into the fighting crowd.
Some of the shots he knew must be hitting the mark
and, after a short time, the wolves again withdrew
into the shelter of the trees leaving, as they could
see, three or four bodies lying in the snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em on the run now,&rdquo; Jack shouted
joyfully, but Bob was not so confident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t believe they
have given it up yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in a few minutes his fears were realized as
they saw, by the dim light, form after form creeping
forward. The wolves were spread out nearly
in a semi-circle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;There must be fifty of them,&rdquo; Jack declared
just as Bob fired again.</p>
<p>His shot went true to the mark but this time the
wolves paid no attention to their fallen companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to take to the tree, Jack,&rdquo; Bob
shouted. &ldquo;You go first and I&rsquo;ll hand the rifle to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately the lowest branches of the big pine,
at the foot of the trench, were near the ground and
Jack, crawling out on the snow, had no trouble in
reaching them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get a hustle,&rdquo; he called, reaching for the rifle
which Bob was holding up to him.</p>
<p>At this moment the wolves, seeing their prey
about to escape, plunged forward with mighty leaps
through the snow, and were almost upon Bob as he
reached for the limb. The leader, an enormous
brute, lank with hunger, sprang from the snow and
his dripping jaws closed on the boy&rsquo;s leg. Fortunately
his leggings were strong and thick and before
the sharp teeth had time to penetrate to the flesh
a shot rang out and the wolf fell back, shot through
the heart. He almost dragged Bob with him so
securely were his teeth fastened in the leggings.
But exerting all his strength, he clung to the branch
and kicked his leg free. A moment later he was
safe in the tree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good shot that,&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;I thought for a
minute that he had me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wolves, as if realizing that their prey was
beyond their reach, broke into a chorus of mournful
howls as they slowly circled around beneath the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they don&rsquo;t smell our provisions,&rdquo; Bob
said, as he shifted to a more comfortable position.</p>
<p>The hope, however, was a vain one, for hardly
had he uttered it when an excited yelp told them,
only too plainly, that their stores were in danger.
The toboggan, with its precious load, although only
a short distance away, was invisible from their position,
as a small pine intervened and they could only
hope and pray that something would be left. Bob
fired several shots in the direction of the snarls and
yelps but, as far as they could tell, without effect.
It was not long before the wolves were back beneath
the tree and taking careful aim at a particularly
large shaggy fellow, Bob fired. The wolf,
with a yelp of pain, fell kicking in the snow and
was almost instantly torn in pieces and devoured by
his companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man may be down but never out, but when
one of those fellows is down it don&rsquo;t take him long
to be out, does it?&rdquo; Jack said as he watched the
fragments of the wolf disappear down the hungry
throats.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;Out is hardly the word,&rdquo; Bob replied grimly.
&ldquo;I should say <i>in</i> was more to the point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he fired and again the performance was
repeated. But now the wolves drew farther away.
They were evidently learning the meaning of that
sharp crack and however hungry were not anxious
to be served up to their equally famished companions.</p>
<p>For some time Bob was unable to get another
shot, but a wolf&rsquo;s memory is short and in the course
of a half hour they came creeping warily back. Bob
waited until one was nearly beneath the tree before
he fired, and then as the pack closed in for the feast,
he poured shot after shot into them. At close
range the carnage was too much even for the ravenous
beasts and leaving several of their number
kicking in the snow the rest turned and fled, making
the forest ring with their howls of terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;ll come back again this
time,&rdquo; Bob said, as he filled the magazine with fresh
cartridges.</p>
<p>And he was right, for gradually the howls grew
fainter and soon nothing save the noise of the storm
could be heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess they&rsquo;ve gone,&rdquo; Jack declared, and Bob
agreed with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;But we better wait awhile and make sure before
we get down,&rdquo; he said as he pulled a pair of thick
mittens from the pocket of his mackinaw and drew
them on his numbed hands.</p>
<p>So great had been the excitement that, until now,
they had not noticed the cold, but now the wind
seemed to penetrate to the very marrow of their
bones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t get down pretty soon I&rsquo;ll turn into
a human icicle,&rdquo; Jack declared after a half hour
had passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;ll be safe enough to risk it,&rdquo; Bob
replied, his teeth chattering so that he could hardly
talk. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll come back again and if
they do we can climb back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A glance at his watch, just as he crawled once
more into his sleeping bag, told Bob that it was
nearly four o&rsquo;clock. How good the thick warm
bags felt after the cold exposure of the tree. In
less than five minutes he was, as he told Jack, &ldquo;as
warm as toast.&rdquo; He resolved that he would not go
to sleep, as he still feared the return of the wolves,
but he said nothing of it to Jack, knowing that the
generous boy would insist in keeping awake also.
So he lay there on the spruce boughs listening to
the storm. It took all his will power to keep his
eyes from closing, but not once did he yield to the
drowsiness. About five o&rsquo;clock he noticed that the
wind was dying down and that the snow had all but
ceased falling. It seemed as though the next hour
would never pass, but at last the hands of the watch
pointed to six and very carefully, so as not to disturb
his brother, he crept out of his bag. It was
still very dark but he knew that daylight was near
at hand and realizing the importance of getting an
early start he tied on his snow-shoes and, ax in
hand, started for the dead pine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>No sound had been heard from the wolves since
shortly after three o&rsquo;clock and he felt certain that
they had left the vicinity. Fully two feet of light
snow had fallen during the night and he found the
tree nearly buried. But by dint of much hard work
he managed to secure what he judged would be
enough to cook breakfast with. &ldquo;Provided the
wolves have left anything,&rdquo; he thought as he picked
up an armful of the dead branches and started
back.</p>
<p>The first faint indication of the approaching dawn
was creeping through the forest as he lit the fire.
Jack was still sleeping soundly, but the crackling
of the flames soon woke him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder you wouldn&rsquo;t call a fellow,&rdquo; he
said with a yawn, as he sat up and rubbed his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need of both of us getting up so early and
I happened to be awake so I thought I might as
well get the wood,&rdquo; Bob replied easily, as he threw
more wood on the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you didn&rsquo;t go to sleep at all, now did
you?&rdquo; Jack asked as he got out of his bag and came
close to the fire.</p>
<p>Pinned down, Bob had to acknowledge that he
had kept watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all right, old fellow. There was no use
in both of us keeping awake, and you know I can
do it much easier than you can,&rdquo; and he gave him
a loving hug, whereupon Jack declared that he was
the best brother in the world.</p>
<p>By this time it was light enough for them to see
for some distance, and Bob suggested that they see
if their visitors had left them anything for breakfast.
From where they stood, at the foot of the
trench, they could see the bodies of not less than a
half dozen wolves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They came out second best anyhow,&rdquo; Jack declared,
as they made their way to the toboggan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as though they had done a pretty good
job here at any rate,&rdquo; Bob said as he looked down
at the wreck at his feet.</p>
<p>The canvass cover was torn to shreds and at first
it looked as though everything had been devoured.
But, knowing that a part of the provisions had consisted
of canned goods, they began to search in the
snow and soon Jack shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the can of coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here&rsquo;s the milk,&rdquo; Bob added a moment
later, as he picked up a small can of condensed milk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>One by one they recovered the cans. Two of
bacon, one of beef tongue, and three of soup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s about all the canned stuff we
had,&rdquo; Bob said as he picked the last can of soup
from the snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the eggs? They were in a tin can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, and we must find them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For fully fifteen minutes they hunted, loath to
give up, and then Jack found the can nearly ten feet
away from the front end of the toboggan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope they&rsquo;re not all smashed,&rdquo; he said as he
pried off the cover. &ldquo;Looks like an omelet,&rdquo; he announced
a moment later, as he stared at the contents
of the can. &ldquo;But I guess we can scramble
them,&rdquo; he added hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get breakfast while you pack up,&rdquo; Jack suggested
as they turned back to the fire.</p>
<p>Filling the coffee pot with snow, he soon had it
melting over the fire, while he picked the bits of
broken shell out of the &ldquo;omelet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so bad at that,&rdquo; Bob declared, as a few
minutes later they were eating bacon and scrambled
eggs, washed down with coffee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, but the trouble is we haven&rsquo;t got enough
left to last more than a couple of days unless we go
on mighty short rations, and you know how keen
I am for that sort of thing. It took all the eggs
I could salvage to make this mess, and there&rsquo;s about
enough bacon for three more meals. That and the
soup and one can of tongue is all we have, but,
thank goodness, there&rsquo;s plenty of coffee and milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the question before the house is, what
shall we do? Shall we turn back or keep on and
trust to luck? We might get a rabbit or two, although
I doubt it,&rdquo; Bob said as he drained his third
dipper of coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I move we go on,&rdquo; Jack said without hesitation.
&ldquo;We can make out for a couple of days anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I second the motion and that makes
it unanimous,&rdquo; Bob declared. &ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;ll have
to go back till we come to that pine and see if we
can get on the trail again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before leaving, they knelt in the trench and
thanked God for His goodness in bringing them in
safety through the great danger.</p>
<p>The freshly fallen snow made heavy going, and
it was eight o&rsquo;clock when they reached the tree
which had been the last mark of the trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">JACK GOES FISHING.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure this is the tree?&rdquo; Jack asked, as
he carefully scanned the trunk of the big tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure? Of course I am. Don&rsquo;t you see where
the bark is rubbed there?&rdquo; Bob replied, pointing to
an abrasion so slight that it is no wonder that it
had escaped Jack&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it now all right,&rdquo; the latter admitted, adding:
&ldquo;Now to see if we can find another one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there is nothing like a heavy snow and wind
storm to erase the tell-tale marks indicating the
passage of a body through the woods. For fully a
half hour they searched but, so far as any sign went,
that mark was the end of the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s go it blind or turn back and give it
up. Which will it be?&rdquo; Bob asked, as he announced
his inability to pick up the trail again.</p>
<p>All traces of the storm, with the exception of the
freshly fallen snow, had disappeared. Not a branch
stirred in the still air and the sun, filtering through,
fell with almost dazzling brightness on the virgin
snow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>After a short discussion it was decided that they
would go on until night, trusting to luck to pick up
the trail. Failing to do so, they would start back
the next morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t starve for a couple of days, even if
we don&rsquo;t get a shot at any game,&rdquo; Jack declared as
he picked up the rope and yanked the toboggan
around.</p>
<p>As nearly as they could estimate two miles an
hour was the best they could do, but they consoled
themselves with the thought that the man they were
after was undoubtedly finding the traveling equally
hard. They kept due north, laying their course by
the sun until it was nearly over head, and then trusting
to the bark and moss on the spruce trees, a bit
of knowledge taught them by their Indian friend.
All through the forenoon they kept sharp watch for
game of any kind, but not a living thing showed
itself.</p>
<p>At twelve o&rsquo;clock they stopped long enough to
build a small fire, over which they made coffee and
warmed a can of vegetable soup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right as far as it goes,&rdquo; Jack laughed, as
he swallowed the last mouthful, &ldquo;but the trouble is
it goes such an awful little ways.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Jack,&rdquo; Bob began, as a sudden thought
struck him, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s strange I didn&rsquo;t think of it before,
but do you know it&rsquo;s more than likely that that pack
of wolves got after Nip or whoever it is we&rsquo;re trying
to follow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope not,&rdquo; Jack replied, after a moment&rsquo;s
thought. &ldquo;If he had enough sense to climb a tree
he&rsquo;d be all right. Of course if they attacked him in
the open it would be different, but it&rsquo;s all woods
around here. If it wasn&rsquo;t, I tell you right now, I&rsquo;d
feel mighty shaky for fear they might come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope you&rsquo;re right, and I dare say you
are,&rdquo; Bob agreed as he took hold of the rope. &ldquo;But
we must be moving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The afternoon was a repetition of the forenoon:
plowing steadily forward, foot by foot, their snow-shoes
sinking deep in the light snow. The light
toboggan fortunately did not greatly impede their
progress, as it made but little impression in the
snow, and they felt confident that, despite their
slow advance, they were probably making as good
as the man they were after, and they hoped better.</p>
<p>Shortly after four o&rsquo;clock they came suddenly in
sight of a good-sized lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be Lake Chemouassa-Banticook,&rdquo;
Bob declared as he stopped. &ldquo;And see, there&rsquo;s a
cabin a little to the right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if there&rsquo;s anybody at home. I don&rsquo;t
see any smoke,&rdquo; Jack said, as they approached the
little hut from the rear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>The front of the cabin faced the lake, and as they
turned the corner both boys stopped short, giving
vent to a cry of joy. Leading away from the door
and extending out on to the lake were the tracks
of snow-shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s no one living here that means that Nip
spent the night in this cabin,&rdquo; Bob declared as he
dropped the rope and, stepping up to the door,
hammered on it with his fist. As there was no reply
after waiting a moment, he tried the latch. The
door was not locked and pushing it open he stepped
inside closely followed by Jack. It was at once
plain to be seen that the place had not been used as
a permanent habitation at least for a long time. It
consisted of a single room in which there was no
furniture with the exception of a single straight
backed chair and a small and very rusty stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was here all right,&rdquo; Jack declared, as he untied
the thongs of his snow-shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I guess we&rsquo;d better follow his example for
tonight,&rdquo; Bob quickly suggested. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll save us
quite a lot of work making a camp and if we can get
a fire to going in that stove it&rsquo;ll at least be warm.
I believe we can do it,&rdquo; he announced a moment
later, after a hasty examination. &ldquo;I imagine Nip
left this morning and we couldn&rsquo;t possibly catch up
with him tonight, so we&rsquo;ll stay here and get a good
early start in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>In one corner of the room they were fortunate
enough to find a few sticks of dry wood and some
old newspapers and in almost less than no time they
had the old stove roaring in good shape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we only had brought along a fish line we
might get a mess of fish out of the lake,&rdquo; Bob remarked
as he pushed another stick into the stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If wishes were horses,&rdquo; Jack began, and then
suddenly stopped in the middle of the quotation.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your fish line,&rdquo; he shouted, as he drew it
from the inside pocket of his mackinaw. &ldquo;Talk
about luck. I remember now putting that line in
my pocket just before we left home and it&rsquo;s been
there ever since. If you&rsquo;ll cut some boughs for beds
I&rsquo;ll guarantee to furnish all the fish you can eat and
then some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a go, but look out if you fall down on your
bargain,&rdquo; Bob laughed as he got the ax from the
toboggan and started for the back of the cabin.</p>
<p>He had, however, taken but a few steps, when
Jack shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, there, come back here with that ax. Think
I can scratch a hole through the ice with my finger
nails?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess perhaps you might have some trouble,
seeing the ice is probably two feet or more thick,&rdquo;
Bob laughed as he turned back. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll help you
and then I can cut the boughs while you are fishing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>The cabin was only a few feet from the shore of
the lake and he quickly followed Jack who, with a
shovel, was already on the ice. Fortunately the
wind had swept the surface of the lake with such
violence that there was but little over a foot of
snow on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if this old lake is froze solid all the
way to the bottom,&rdquo; Bob grunted, as he straightened
up after some ten minutes of vigorous chopping.
He had cut down all of two feet and still there was
no sign of water. He would chop a minute or two
and then Jack would shovel out the chunks of ice.
They knew that the ice froze pretty deep on the
lakes of Northern Maine, but even they were surprised
when they were obliged to go still another
foot before the ax cut through to the water. Once
through, it was but the work of a minute to enlarge
the hole sufficiently to allow a whale, as Jack laughingly
declared, to be pulled through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to use for bait?&rdquo; Bob asked
as he started back toward the cabin with the ax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only thing we got is that beef tongue,&rdquo; Jack
replied, as he pulled the small can from his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go as light as you can on it,&rdquo; Bob called back.
&ldquo;I want a bite of it for supper in case you don&rsquo;t get
any fish.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;Huh, not a supposable case at all,&rdquo; Jack declared
indignantly, as he opened the can with his knife and
proceeded to bait the hook with a small bit of the
meat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping they like tongue as well as I do,&rdquo;
he thought as he lowered the hook into the water.</p>
<p>For fully fifteen minutes he crouched over the
hole without even a nibble, pulling the line up every
few minutes to see if the meat had fallen off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ought to be hungry enough to eat tongue
even if they don&rsquo;t care for it as a steady diet,&rdquo; he
thought. Then it occurred to him that perhaps the
noise of the chopping had scared the fish away and
that it might be some time before they would venture
back to that part of the lake. So he kept his
patience and resigned himself to a long wait if necessary.
Another ten minutes passed and still no
bite came to encourage him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boughs all cut and beds made. How about your
part of the bargain?&rdquo; Bob shouted from the door
of the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing yet,&rdquo; Jack had to call back, much
chagrined at his failure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;d better hurry up: it&rsquo;s getting dark
pretty fast and I&rsquo;m getting hungry,&rdquo; Bob shouted
back, as he disappeared in the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope he don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m enjoying this,&rdquo; Jack
said to himself as he, for the twentieth time, started
to pull in his line.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>Then, suddenly, his heart gave a jump as he felt
a strong tug on the line. He gave a quick yank
but, to his disgust, failed to hook the fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope you like it well enough to try again,&rdquo; he
muttered, as he put a fresh piece of the tongue on
the hook.</p>
<p>To his great joy the fish did, for he had hardly
gotten the hook in the water before it was seized
again and this time he pulled in a speckled trout
fully twenty inches long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one good meal ahead of the game anyhow,&rdquo;
he thought as he took the hook from the
trout&rsquo;s mouth and baited it again.</p>
<p>The fish had evidently returned in force, and for
the next half hour the boy was kept busy pulling
them in as rapidly as he could handle them. Then,
knowing that he had as many as they could possibly
use, he began to wind in the line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about it?&rdquo; Bob shouted, as he again appeared
in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got one,&rdquo; Jack called back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be up in a
minute.&rdquo; And picking up the largest trout, a splendid
specimen, weighing not less than five pounds,
he waded through the snow to the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a beauty and no mistake,&rdquo; Bob declared as
his brother held the fish up for his inspection. &ldquo;Too
bad you didn&rsquo;t get some more like him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who said I didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Jack grinned. &ldquo;If we can
scare up something to put them in, I&rsquo;ll show you a
dozen more nearly as big as this fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean it?&rdquo; and Bob caught his brother
by the arm and for a moment the two boys gave a
good imitation of an Indian war dance as they
leaped about the room.</p>
<p>After a short search Jack found an old gunny
sack which he declared would fill the bill, and leaving
Bob to dress the trout he hurried back for the
rest of the catch.</p>
<p>Except for their electric flashlights, the only
source of illumination they were able to find was a
single bit of candle about three inches long. But so
happy were they in knowing that they had plenty
of food, they made the best of it without a murmur,
and in another half hour supper was ready. To be
sure they had no salt, their supply of that article
having been lost in the havoc which the wolves had
wrought with the pack. Still they had a small
amount of bacon left and by using a small amount
of it the fish, although a bit flat, was, as Jack declared,
&ldquo;not half bad and a whole lot better than
nothing at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as supper was over and the few dishes
cleaned up, they put out the candle, of which not
much more than an inch remained, and for perhaps
an hour they sat and talked by the light which came
from the open door of the stove.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do a little deducing,&rdquo; Bob announced
after he had filled the stove as full as possible.
&ldquo;While you were fishing I hunted around a
bit, and over there in the corner I found two pint
bottles which, by the smell, have had whiskey in
them not long ago. It&rsquo;s fair to think that they
belonged to Nip and that he drank the contents.
As there were two of them he must have drank
over a pint from the time he got here till he left, and
if he did the chances are that he didn&rsquo;t get a very
early start this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are deducing, if I get you right, that Nip
isn&rsquo;t very far ahead of us, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Jack asked
as Bob paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right the first time, and what&rsquo;s more, you may
or may not have noticed that those tracks were not
very straight, which seems to indicate that whoever
made them had been &lsquo;looking on the wine when it
was red.&rsquo; No, I feel almost certain that our friend is
not very far away, and if we start around four
o&rsquo;clock we ought to catch up with him before night.
How does that strike you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right between the eyes,&rdquo; Jack replied without
hesitation.</p>
<p>Anything which Bob said was usually right in
his brother&rsquo;s eyes, not only because of the love he
had for him, but he knew, from many experiences,
that Bob&rsquo;s judgment was pretty apt to be sound.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;But if we&rsquo;re going to hit the trail by four
o&rsquo;clock, I think it would be a good plan to hit the
hay right now,&rdquo; Jack proposed as he got up from
his seat on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit the boughs, you mean,&rdquo; Bob laughed as he
followed suit. &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;d better, seeing that
the fire is about out and there&rsquo;s only about enough
wood to get breakfast in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s watch told him that it was just three
o&rsquo;clock when he opened his eyes, and for a moment
he struggled against the almost irresistible desire
to go to sleep again. But he knew that much depended
on an early start. So making as little
noise as possible, he got out of his sleeping bag.
But before going to sleep the night before, Jack had
made a resolution with himself that he would wake
as soon as Bob stirred, and this time he was successful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought you&rsquo;d get ahead of me again, hey?&rdquo;
he growled good-naturedly, as Bob was getting to
his feet. &ldquo;My, but it&rsquo;s dark as the ace of spades
and then some,&rdquo; he muttered, squirming out of his
bag.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>They made short work of getting breakfast, and
it was but a few minutes after four o&rsquo;clock when
they were ready to start. While eating they debated
the advisability of leaving the toboggan at
the cabin, and taking with them only enough for a
single meal. But finally they decided that it would
be best not to take such a course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The toboggan is so light that we can make
almost as good time with it, and we&rsquo;re not at all
sure that we won&rsquo;t have to sleep out tonight, and
without the duds we&rsquo;d have to roost in a tree and
it would be mighty cold,&rdquo; Bob declared.</p>
<p>The stars shone with a still cold dimness as they
started off. The traveling was still heavy, although
the snow had settled a trifle and their snow-shoes
did not sink quite as deep as the day before. The
trail led straight across the lake toward the north,
and it was plainly evident to the boys that the man
who had made it must have been under the influence
of liquor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See how uneven the prints are,&rdquo; Bob pointed
out, throwing the light of his flash on the snow
ahead. &ldquo;He had hard work to keep his feet straight
and you can see that he stopped every few minutes.
I doubt very much if he made more than ten miles
yesterday, especially if he had more whiskey with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was about five miles across the lake to the
opposite shore and they reached it at half-past five.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty good time, considering,&rdquo; Bob declared as
he glanced at his watch. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet it took him three
hours or more to make it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>The trail now led up the side of a hill which was
little less than a mountain, and as the growth of
trees was very heavy it was a hard struggle to drag
the toboggan between them. It was perhaps a little
over a mile from the shore of the lake to the top
of the hill, but the first streaks of red were tinging
the eastern sky when, panting and puffing, they
reached the summit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, but that was some climb, believe me,&rdquo; Jack
panted as he leaned against a large spruce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we didn&rsquo;t make very good time coming up
the hill that&rsquo;s a fact, but it&rsquo;s a pretty safe bet that
Nip didn&rsquo;t do it in much better time even if he
didn&rsquo;t have to pull a toboggan,&rdquo; Bob declared
stooping to fasten his snow-shoes a bit tighter.</p>
<p>The way now led down hill through a thick
growth of pines and after a short rest they were off
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look Jack, here&rsquo;s where he stopped to cook a
meal,&rdquo; Bob said after they had gone about a half
a mile farther. &ldquo;See, here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s left of his fire,
and sure&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re born there&rsquo;s a stick with a few
live sparks still on it. That means that he was here
not much more than an hour ago and perhaps less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had hardly spoken the words when they were
startled by a voice from a thick growth of bushes
a few feet to their left. They turned quickly but
no one was in sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he&rsquo;s still here,&rdquo; the voice had declared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, why not come out and show yourself,&rdquo;
Bob said, as soon as he recovered his surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come when it suits me and not before,&rdquo; the
voice growled. &ldquo;And in the meantime you two
stand right where you are. I&rsquo;ve got yer covered
and I&rsquo;d about as soon shoot as eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the voice uttered these threatening words, its
owner stepped into view. The boys at once recognized
Nip the hunchback, despite the fact that his
face was covered with a thick growth of hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what are you all a followin&rsquo; me fer?&rdquo; he
demanded, as he stepped to within about six feet
of them and stopped.</p>
<p>The boys saw that he had uttered no idle threat,
for he held in his right an ugly looking revolver.
It was also evident that, however drunk he might
have been the day before, he was perfectly sober
now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said we were following you,&rdquo; Bob asked.
&ldquo;I believe this is a free country, and I guess we
have as much right to be here as you have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, cut it out, kid, I heared yer talkin&rsquo;, so
what&rsquo;s the use of tryin&rsquo; ter bluff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, have it your own way,&rdquo; Bob replied
pleasantly, trying to appear unconcerned. &ldquo;You
seem to have the drop on us. May I ask what you
intend to do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;That depends on you all,&rdquo; the man declared
after a moment&rsquo;s thought. &ldquo;I asked yer what fer
ye&rsquo;r a followin&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the circumstances I guess it&rsquo;s a fair question
and I&rsquo;ll give you a fair answer,&rdquo; Bob replied.
&ldquo;I have reason to think that you have a deed to
some timber land which belongs to my father and
we have followed you to get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes yer think I&rsquo;ve got it?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s neither here nor there,&rdquo; Bob replied in
decided tones. &ldquo;The question is whether or not you
have got it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;pose I have, what&rsquo;s it worth ter you?&rdquo; the
man asked with an ugly grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean how much will we give you for
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about the size of it,&rdquo; the man replied
with a still broader grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a cent,&rdquo; Bob answered in stern tones. &ldquo;That
deed belongs to my father, and if you were an honest
man you would have given it to him and he
would have doubtless given you a generous reward,
but now you don&rsquo;t get a single cent for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t yer be too sure about that part of it. I
know of a man who&rsquo;ll be glad ter pay me a good
price fer it and don&rsquo;t yer forgit it,&rdquo; he declared,
taking a step nearer the boys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you acknowledge that you have it?&rdquo; Bob
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t acknowledging nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; the man
growled. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;ve got it, it&rsquo;s my business, an&rsquo; if I
ain&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s my business too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this conversation Nip had held the revolver
pointed directly at Bob, and to tell the truth
the latter was far from feeling as unconcerned as
he appeared. He had had dealings with the man
before and he was well aware of his unprincipled
character. He also knew that the man was a coward
unless all the odds were on his side. But now
they were far away from any human being and he
did not doubt, for a minute, that he would hesitate
to kill them both if he thought that it was to his
advantage to do so. The situation, he felt, demanded
immediate and heroic measures.</p>
<p>Jack was standing about four feet to the right,
and, as he caught the boy&rsquo;s eye, he gave a slight nod
to his head, at the same time gazing intently over
Nip&rsquo;s left shoulder. It was an old trick, but it
worked. The man saw the nod and quickly turned
his head. Instantly Bob&rsquo;s right foot came up with
all his strength behind it, the toe of the snow-shoe
catching the hunchback&rsquo;s wrist. The revolver flew
from his hand and was lost in the snow several feet
away. With a hoarse cry of anger and pain the
man sprang to recover the gun, but before he was
half way to it Bob was upon him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>They came down in a heap of snow, Bob on the
top. But despite his deformity, Nip was possessed
of great strength, and Bob, while strong, was only
a boy. To be sure he knew far more of the science
of wrestling than did the man, but handicapped by
the snow-shoes and the deep snow, there was little
or no chance to bring his skill into play. It was a
place where brute strength was at a premium. Over
and over they tumbled, now one on top and then
the other, each striving to get an advantageous hold.</p>
<p>At the same instant that Bob had jumped for Nip,
Jack had leaped for the revolver. He found it
quickly and thrust it into the pocket of his mackinaw
and then hurried to his brother&rsquo;s assistance.
But so violently were they thrashing about in the
snow that for some time he was unable to do more
than stand close by and wait for a favorable opportunity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>Meanwhile neither seemed to be gaining any decided
advantage. Once Bob had gotten a half Nelson
around the man&rsquo;s neck, but with a violent effort
he had quickly broken the hold. Again, Nip being
for the moment on top, had seized Bob by the throat,
and exerting all his strength had nearly succeeded
in shutting off the boy&rsquo;s wind. For the moment
Bob thought he was licked, but he managed to get
hold of the man&rsquo;s wrist, and with a violent jerk tore
the fingers away. A moment later the opportunity
for which Jack was watching came, and he was
quick to take advantage of it.</p>
<p>Nip was again on top and had just drawn back
his fist, evidently hoping to put an end to the fight
then and there. To do this he was obliged to raise
his head, and instantly Jack had him around the
neck and exerting all his strength succeeded in pulling
him over backward. This allowed Bob to work
himself free, and before Nip could struggle to his
knees, Jack had stepped back and drawn the revolver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good boy Jack,&rdquo; Bob shouted, as he struggled
to his feet. &ldquo;Keep him covered a minute till I get
these shoes straightened out a bit and then we&rsquo;ll
tend to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for Nip, when he saw that the tables were
turned against him, all his courage evaporated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot,&rdquo; he whined, struggling to get to
his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s different when the shoe&rsquo;s on the other foot,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Jack taunted. &ldquo;Now, if you want to get
away with a whole skin, just hand over that deed,&rdquo;
he ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got no deed,&rdquo; the man declared sullenly.
&ldquo;I was only fooling when I asked yer how much
ye&rsquo;d give fer it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;You hold the gun on him while I take a look,&rdquo;
Bob ordered.</p>
<p>Somewhat to his surprise Nip offered no objection
to being searched. On the contrary, he appeared
to welcome it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell yer I didn&rsquo;t have no deed?&rdquo; he
grinned, after Bob had gone through all his pockets
without finding the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you told the truth for once in your life,&rdquo;
Bob said as he stepped back. &ldquo;But, just the same,
I&rsquo;ll bet you know where it is all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebby I do and mebby I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the man
grinned. &ldquo;But if I do it&rsquo;s where yer can&rsquo;t never
find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment a lucky thought struck Jack.
&ldquo;I say Bob,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;how about his pack? He
must have one somewhere around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s heart jumped as he saw the look of anger
which swept the man&rsquo;s face as Jack made the suggestion.
He no longer doubted but that he had the
deed stowed away in his pack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hold him and I&rsquo;ll have a look,&rdquo; he said,
starting toward the clump of bushes where he had
been hiding.</p>
<p>After a short search he found a fair sized pack
rolled in a heavy blanket strapped at either end.
He carried it out to where Jack had the man cowering
under the threat of the revolver.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, Nip, it&rsquo;ll expedite matters a bit if
you&rsquo;ll find the deed and hand it over,&rdquo; he said as he
threw the pack down at the man&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on a minute there, Bob,&rdquo; Jack said.
&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better look yourself? He may have
another gun in that roll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, son, I never thought of that.
How about it, Nip? Got another gun there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I got no more gun,&rdquo; the man grumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, seeing as how your word doesn&rsquo;t mean
anything, I&rsquo;m not going to take any chances on it,&rdquo;
Bob declared as he picked up the roll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You made a mighty lucky guess, Jack,&rdquo; he declared
a moment later, holding up an automatic
which he had found in the pack. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;d got hold
of this little plaything he might have had the drop
on us again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pack contained a small supply of provisions
and a mess kit such as is used in the army. There
was little else, an old woolen shirt and two pairs of
thick socks. Bob had about concluded that the man
did not have the deed after all, when, as he picked
up the shirt, he felt something in the pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is, I guess,&rdquo; he shouted as he drew out
a long envelope which had been folded over in the
middle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>With eager fingers he pulled out the paper, and
the next moment gave vent to a whoop of joy as
he saw that it was the missing deed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess this&rsquo;ll put a crimp in Big Ben&rsquo;s plans,&rdquo;
he cried, as he thrust it in the inside pocket of his
shirt. &ldquo;I told you you wouldn&rsquo;t get a cent for it,&rdquo;
he said, turning to the infuriated man. &ldquo;This is one
time when it would have paid you to have been on
the square. And now,&rdquo; he added, turning to Jack,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got what we came for and we&rsquo;ll be beating
it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will give me back one of the guns before
you go?&rdquo; Nip whined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes we will&mdash;not,&rdquo; Bob replied. &ldquo;We know
how much our lives would be worth if you had one
of these guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I swar I&rsquo;ll not hurt you,&rdquo; Nip began, but
Bob interrupted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save your breath, Nip. I wouldn&rsquo;t believe you
on a stack of Bibles a mile high. Some time when
you&rsquo;re in Skowhegan stop round and you can have
them both, but now they stay with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the wolves. I will have nothing to protect
myself with.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>This was a phase of the matter which had not
occurred to either of the boys. To leave even such
a man as Nip defenseless in the wilderness when
they knew that there was a very real danger from
wolves was a serious proposition, and on the other
hand, to give him one of the revolvers was, they
felt, little less than suicide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What had we better do?&rdquo; Bob asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Search me,&rdquo; Jack replied, with a shake of his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me de gun and you&rsquo;ll never see me again,&rdquo;
Nip promised in a pleading tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for a minute,&rdquo; Bob said sternly. &ldquo;Whatever
else we do, it won&rsquo;t be that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob motioned to Jack to step back a few feet,
and for several minutes they talked in low tones.
Finally they made up their minds what to do, and
coming back to where Nip was standing, Bob said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve decided to give you your choice of two
courses. You can go on and take your chance. It&rsquo;s
only about eight or ten miles to the Canadian
border, and there is a small town just over the line
and you can get a gun there if you intend to go farther.
Or you can go back with us. Now which
will it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a chance and go on,&rdquo; the man said,
after a moment&rsquo;s thought. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll get you sometime
for this and don&rsquo;t ye forgit it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without wasting any more words, the boys
picked up the rope of the toboggan and started
back, leaving Nip rolling up his pack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope the wolves don&rsquo;t get him,&rdquo; Jack said, as
soon as they were out of hearing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess there&rsquo;s not a whole lot of danger. He
ought to reach the border in a little over two hours,&rdquo;
Bob replied, adding: &ldquo;Anyhow, I don&rsquo;t see how we
could have done any different. He&rsquo;d have shot us
quick as a wink if he&rsquo;d got a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was just noon when they reached the old cabin
on the lake. They had intended to get a hasty dinner
and then travel until dark; but, after talking it
over, they decided to wait and get an early start in
the morning, and try to make the Carry in one day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting better going all the time as the snow
settles, and if we get off by four o&rsquo;clock I believe
we can make it,&rdquo; Bob declared. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;d rather
do that than camp out again. I don&rsquo;t much care for
another set to with that pack of wolves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got to have some wood if we&rsquo;re
going to stay here all night. We used all there was
in the shack getting breakfast this morning,&rdquo; Jack
said, as he began to untie the pack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what I can find if you&rsquo;ll get a couple of
those trout ready;&rdquo; and, taking the ax, Bob started
for the woods back of the cabin.</p>
<p>He was obliged to hunt for some time before he
found a dead tree, and it was all of an hour before
he returned with his arms full of wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d about concluded that either Nip or the
wolves had got you,&rdquo; Jack laughed, as Bob threw
the wood on the floor in front of the stove.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thought I&rsquo;d never find any,&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;But
I&rsquo;ve got quite a lot cut up and I&rsquo;ll bring it in while
you&rsquo;re getting dinner; but, for goodness&rsquo; sake,
make it snappy. I&rsquo;m hungry enough to eat one of
those fish raw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our bill of fare is slightly limited as to variety,
although the quantity is all right,&rdquo; Jack laughed a
little later, as they were eating fish and drinking
coffee. &ldquo;If I have to eat trout much longer I&rsquo;ll be
growing fins and a tail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say that fish is good brain food, and if
that&rsquo;s so you and I ought to carry off all the prizes
at The Fortress next term,&rdquo; Bob said as he helped
himself to another cup of coffee.</p>
<p>They ate again about six o&rsquo;clock, and an hour
later they were sound asleep in their sleeping bags,
Bob&rsquo;s mental alarm clock, as Jack called it, set for
three o&rsquo;clock. It was some three hours later when
Bob was suddenly awakened by the sound of someone
trying to push open the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER X.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">JACQUES LAMONT.</span></h2>
<p>For a moment he thought he must have been mistaken
and it was nothing but a dream, but as he lay
and listened the sound was repeated. He remembered
that he had barred the door before going to
bed, and now he thanked his lucky star that he had
done so. As the sound was repeated, now with
more force, he reached over and gave Jack a shake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;S-s-s-h,&rdquo; he whispered, as Jack stirred and was
about to speak. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s somebody trying the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s Nip,&rdquo; Jack whispered as he sat up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not likely,&rdquo; Bob whispered back. &ldquo;You have
the gun ready and I&rsquo;ll ask who it is;&rdquo; and, getting
out of his bag, he crept close to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>For a moment there was no answer, then a voice
replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eet&rsquo;s me, Jacques Lamont.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>As quickly as possible Bob withdrew the bar
and threw open the door. By the light of the moon
he saw a powerfully built man standing in the doorway,
and the next moment the two were shaking
hands as though they would never stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weel, weel, to think of seeing you way up here,
and Jack too,&rdquo; the Frenchman almost shouted, as
Jack, having shed his bag, rushed forward, and
throwing his arms around the man&rsquo;s neck, gave him
a bear like hug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where in the world did you come from?&rdquo; Bob
asked, as soon as Jack let the Frenchman loose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I been trapping up long Glazier Lake. Geet
beeg lot ver&rsquo; fine fur and take hem to Greenville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jacques Lamont was an old and very much loved
friend of the Golden boys. He had worked for Mr.
Golden off and on for many years, and the boys had
always declared that he was the best Frenchman in
the world. Now well past fifty, Jacques was as
young and spry as most men of thirty. Straight as
an arrow, his fame as an athlete was state wide.
On more than one occasion they had seen him walk
beneath a bar without stooping, and then run and
leap over it. A fine physical specimen of manhood,
his character was on a par with his physique.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have eat supper, oui. One minute till I feex
these dogs and I be with you,&rdquo; Jacques said as he
passed out into the night again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>Both the boys followed him, and at sight of the
strangers the four dogs set up a loud yelping; but,
at a word from Jacques, they quickly quieted down.
They were large rangy beasts, resembling closely
the huge timber wolves, which they had fought.
They were harnessed to a long sled, which was piled
high with various pelts. It took the Frenchman but
a few minutes to &ldquo;stable&rdquo; his team for the night,
as all he did was to slip the harness from them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No danger of them running away?&rdquo; Bob asked,
as they returned to the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a leetle bit,&rdquo; Jacques laughed as he warmed
his hands at the stove into which Jack had piled
several pieces of wood and which was now roaring
again.</p>
<p>Although they had no light except their flashlights
and that which came from the open door of
the stove, the moon shone in at the window so that
they were easily able to see each other.</p>
<p>Sitting on the floor in front of the stove, the boys
gave their friend a full account of their trip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oui, I meet heem,&rdquo; Jacques interrupted, when
Bob had related their encounter with Nip. &ldquo;He
most to the border when we meet. He look a bad
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sure is,&rdquo; Jack laughed, &ldquo;and here&rsquo;s hoping
that we&rsquo;ve seen the last of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oui, we make eet all right,&rdquo; Jacques declared,
when the boys told him of their intention of making
the Carry the next day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s alarm clock went off at the appointed time
the next morning, but he found that Jacques was up
ahead of him and had the fire going. The Frenchman
had a small supply of flapjack flour, and it
made a very welcome addition to their trout menu.</p>
<p>By four o&rsquo;clock the dogs had been fed and harnessed
and they were ready for the start. Jacques
cracked his long whip and the dogs sprang forward,
setting a pace that made the boys exert themselves
to their utmost to follow. The Frenchman swung
along directly behind the sled with no apparent
effort. The boys knew that both man and dogs
could keep up the rapid pace all day, but at the end
of the first hour they were, as Jack declared in a
low tone to Bob, &ldquo;about all in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey there, Jacques,&rdquo; Bob shouted. &ldquo;What do
you think we are? I didn&rsquo;t mean that we expected
to get to Carry before dinner time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Frenchman shouted a command to the dogs,
and they at once came to a halt and sat down on
their haunches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon moi,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;I forgeet, you not
so used to go fast. We take leetle rest, oui, and
then we go not so fast, hey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast is right,&rdquo; Jack laughed, as he leaned
against a big spruce. &ldquo;These long legs of yours
just naturally seem to eat up space, but ours aren&rsquo;t
so long.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>While they were resting Bob attempted to pet the
dogs, but low, deep throated growls warned him not
to get too friendly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They no like strangers,&rdquo; Jacques explained.
&ldquo;Take um three four days geet quainted, then they
make friend all right if um like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll take your word for it,&rdquo; Bob laughed.
&ldquo;That big leader has sure got a dandy set of teeth
and he looks as though he&rsquo;d rather enjoy taking a
sample out of my leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes they were off again, but now, in
obedience to a command from Jacques, the dogs set
a more moderate pace. Still it was, as Jack declared,
plenty fast enough, and at the end of another
hour Bob had to call a second halt. At ten o&rsquo;clock
they reached the spot where they had spent the first
night of the trip, and here they stopped to cook
their dinner and feed the dogs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We mak de carry by seex o&rsquo;clock eef all goes
well,&rdquo; Jacques declared as he began to harness the
dogs again.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact they did a little better than
his estimate, for at half-past five the lights of the
little settlement hove in sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, just in time to eat. Hurry up and take
a seat,&rdquo; was Ezra Kimball&rsquo;s greeting as they pushed
open the door of the store. &ldquo;Did you get the deed,
or had he too much lead?&rdquo; he asked as soon as they
were fairly inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got it all right, thanks to you,&rdquo; Bob replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff. Knew you were good enough,&rdquo;
Ezra chuckled as he opened a door at the back of
the store and called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supper ready, mother? Put on two more plates
and then another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that you&rsquo;ve got trout for supper,
Ezra,&rdquo; Jack said anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a trout, that I know about,&rdquo; Ezra assured
him, and Jack explained his antipathy to the fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve eaten so many trout since we&rsquo;ve been
gone that I&rsquo;ll be ashamed to ever look one in the
face again,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p>His fears were groundless and, while they were
eating the excellent supper which Ezra&rsquo;s wife sat
before them, they told again the story of their trip.
There was a &rsquo;phone in the store, and as soon as
supper was over Bob called his father and told him
of the recovery of the deed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Mr. Golden declared, his voice expressing
his pleasure. &ldquo;That will save me a good
many thousand dollars. You two boys certainly
do beat the Dutch. Tom &rsquo;phoned yesterday from
Greenville and said that Ben had begun to cut on
the tract. Now I&rsquo;ll be up in a few days, as soon as
I can get away, but when you get back to camp you
might go and see Ben and tell him that you have
found the deed, but don&rsquo;t take it with you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>Bob gave his father a brief account of their trip
but did not mention the wolves, as he knew that
the thought would worry him. As soon as he told
him of their meeting with Jacques and that the
latter was going to Greenville the next day, Mr.
Golden suggested that they give the deed to him
and have him leave it at the First National Bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be safe there,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m afraid it
won&rsquo;t be at the camp, as the safe there does not
amount to much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were very tired and went to bed soon
after supper, knowing that Jacques wished to get a
fairly early start the next morning.</p>
<p>The first man they saw, as they entered the lumber
camp the next day, was Tom Bean. Jacques
had not stopped, as he wished to reach Greenville
as soon as possible to dispose of his furs. But he
had promised them that he was coming back in a
day or two and would stay a few days with them.
As soon as they saw Tom they knew that something
was wrong. Tom never wore that look on
his face unless he was deeply troubled. However,
his face brightened as he caught sight of the two
boys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s about time yez was a gitting back,&rdquo;
he called from the office door. &ldquo;What luck?&rdquo; he
asked, as he came forward to meet them, holding
out both hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best in the world,&rdquo; Bob replied, as he shook
one hand while Jack did the same to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glory be! Sure an&rsquo; I knowed ye&rsquo;d do it if it
could be did. But come on in the office an&rsquo; tell us
all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom listened without once interrupting while
they told about the trip, and when they had finished
he congratulated them heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the trouble here, Tom?&rdquo; Bob asked.
&ldquo;I knew the minute I laid eyes on you that something
had gone wrong, so out with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye said a mouthful then,&rdquo; Tom replied gloomily,
as he thrust a big hunk of wood into the fire.
&ldquo;Sure and there&rsquo;s the dickens to pay, so there is.
Day afore yisterday Jim broke his off hind leg and
o&rsquo; course had ter be shot, and thin yisterday mornin&rsquo;
when the drivers went to hitch up, they found six
o&rsquo; the horses sick, and two o&rsquo; thim has died since.
This mornin&rsquo; three more were sick in the same way,
and thot laves us wid only three ter do the haulin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what seems to be the matter with them?&rdquo;
Jack asked anxiously, as Tom paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and it&rsquo;s meself as don&rsquo;t know. I had Doc
Sam up from Greenville yisterday but all he could
say was thot they must a eat sumpin thot give &rsquo;em
the colic.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose it&rsquo;s some more of Ben&rsquo;s work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Niver a bit o&rsquo; doubt of it,&rdquo; Tom replied quickly,
and there was in his voice a note of anger which the
boys had seldom heard. &ldquo;Somebody has put sumpin
in the feed as did it and who else would be after
doin&rsquo; a mane trick like thot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you told Father?&rdquo; Bob asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yit. I&rsquo;m after goin&rsquo; down ter the village
right after dinner and see if I kin hire some horses,
and I&rsquo;ll telephone him then. But it&rsquo;s meself thot&rsquo;s
afeared thot I can&rsquo;t git a horse at all at all, and
there&rsquo;s the logs a pilin&rsquo; up and no horses ter haul
thim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had Father on the &rsquo;phone last night and he
said that Ben had started to cut on the tract,&rdquo; Bob
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and he&rsquo;s been cuttin&rsquo; fer two days now,
and he got all of 100,000 fate down areddy, and it&rsquo;s
the finest spruce yer iver laid yer eyes on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment the dinner horn sounded its welcome
blast through the forest and telling Tom to
keep up his courage, the boys hurried to the mess
house. Soon the men began to troop in by twos and
threes, and as they caught sight of the boys all had
a hearty word of greeting for them, especially Jean
Larue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;I mees you beeg plenty,&rdquo; the latter declared as
he took his seat beside Jack. &ldquo;I tink it be one two
week you been gone, oui?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly so long as that,&rdquo; Bob laughed, as he
heaped his plate with potatoes and beef steak. &ldquo;But
we&rsquo;re mighty glad to be back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as dinner was over Tom harnessed his
driving horse to the light cutter and was off for
Greenville. The boys, as soon as the men had returned
to their work, put on their snow-shoes and
started for Big Ben&rsquo;s camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be mad as a bear with a sore head,&rdquo; Bob
declared, as they trudged along over the snow which
was now so well packed that the broad shoes hardly
made any impression. &ldquo;Be mighty careful what
you say,&rdquo; he cautioned. &ldquo;You know what he is
when his dander is up, and it&rsquo;ll be up a plenty when
he learns that we&rsquo;ve got that deed and all the timber
he has cut on the tract will have to be turned over
to Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon they could hear the sound of axes ringing
through the stillness of the forest, interspersed with
the shouts and laughter of the men as they sang and
joked at their work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seem to be in mighty good spirits all
right,&rdquo; Jack declared, as they came in sight of the
cutting.</p>
<p>For a moment they stood watching the scene to
see if they could locate Big Ben.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;There he is over there by that big tree to the
left,&rdquo; Jack whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, come on and we&rsquo;ll get it over as soon
as possible. But remember what I said and let me
do the talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Big Ben was busy talking with one of his men as
the boys approached, and at first failed to notice
them. They waited until he looked up and saw
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, Mr. Donahue,&rdquo; Bob greeted
him pleasantly.</p>
<p>For an instant a look of anger flashed into the
big man&rsquo;s face, but he quickly controlled himself
and forcing a smile said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello boys. Been takin&rsquo; a walk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes. I guess you&rsquo;d call it that,&rdquo; Bob returned
smiling. &ldquo;We thought we&rsquo;d come down and
see how the new cutting was going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; fine, as you can see. Don&rsquo;t think
I ever saw better timber. Lots of those trees&rsquo;ll
scale close to a thousand feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re right there,&rdquo; Bob replied slowly,
letting his eyes glance at the fallen monarchs.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll help us out a lot on our contract,&rdquo; he added
easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On your contract!&rdquo; the big man exploded, the
look of anger returning to his face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; Bob said quietly. &ldquo;Why not?
They belong to Father, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothin&rsquo; of the kind,&rdquo; Big Ben shouted.
&ldquo;Them trees belong ter me and I&rsquo;ve got the papers
to prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it, Mr. Donahue,&rdquo; Bob said. &ldquo;But as
I told you once before, that is a matter for the
courts to decide. But what we really came down
for was to tell you that Father&rsquo;s deed to this tract
has been found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; the big man shouted, so loudly that several
of the workmen nearby glanced up. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
believe a word of it,&rdquo; he declared in a slightly lower
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we don&rsquo;t ask you to,&rdquo; Bob said calmly.
&ldquo;Having told you the facts, we consider that we
have done all that could be expected of us. It is
immaterial to us whether or not you believe it and
whether or not you keep on with the cutting. Of
course the more you get down the less Father&rsquo;ll
have to cut, and if he were not an honest man as
well as a generous one, he&rsquo;d have let you go on
cutting for the rest of the winter before letting you
know about the deed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob had hoped that the explanation would serve
to mollify the man but it seemed to have exactly the
opposite effect. Big Ben&rsquo;s face grew darker and
darker as he listened to the boy, and he clinched
and unclinched his hands in a nervous effort to control
himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got the deed, let&rsquo;s see it,&rdquo; he demanded
angrily, as soon as Bob had finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t got it with us,&rdquo; Bob replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nor you haven&rsquo;t got it anywhere else
neither,&rdquo; the big man sneered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a cooked
up lie to try to make me stop chopping, but it hain&rsquo;t
a goin&rsquo; to work; not no cock and bull yarn like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do just as you think best, Mr. Donahue,&rdquo; Bob
said still pleasantly. &ldquo;If you really think we are
lying you would, of course, be very foolish to let it
interfere with your work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you find the deed?&rdquo; Ben asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s something that I can&rsquo;t tell you just at
present,&rdquo; Bob replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the other sneered. &ldquo;And
there&rsquo;s a mighty good reason why you can&rsquo;t too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; Bob said. &ldquo;And now, having
completed our errand, we&rsquo;ll go back. Come on
Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Big Ben turned away muttering something about
two kids thinking they were smart, and, without
further words, the boys started for their camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he was bluffing?&rdquo; Jack asked, as
soon as they were out of hearing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he was,&rdquo; Bob replied. &ldquo;Ben knows
Father and us too, for that matter, too well to
believe that we&rsquo;d say that we had the deed when
we didn&rsquo;t have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right, but do you think he&rsquo;ll keep
on cutting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you would say something about the
horses,&rdquo; Jack said a moment later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I did intend to at first, but, after all,
what&rsquo;s the use. He&rsquo;d have denied knowing anything
about it, of course, and we haven&rsquo;t any proof
you know,&rdquo; Bob said, a note of sadness in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were right, of course,&rdquo; Jack replied. &ldquo;But
it seems to me that it is about up to us to get the
proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sentiments exactly,&rdquo; Bob agreed. &ldquo;It fairly
makes my blood boil to think of those poor horses
suffering. The ghost and the whiskey were not so
bad, but when they start to torturing poor dumb
beasts in order to get the best of us, it&rsquo;s time something
was done and don&rsquo;t you forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On reaching the camp they went at once to the
big shed about a hundred feet behind the cook house,
where the horses were kept. There they found a
halfbreed, whose only name so far as anyone knew
was Sam, doctoring the sick horses. Sam knew and
loved horses and was a very capable and reliable
man when it came to tending them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Sam, how are the patients,&rdquo; Bob called
as they entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ver&rsquo; seek, but I tink dey geet well all but
the two who dead,&rdquo; Sam replied.</p>
<p>The boys could plainly see that the horses were
indeed very sick and the hot tears sprang to their
eyes as they looked at the suffering animals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any idea what caused it?&rdquo; Bob asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oui, I tink it in der oats. You come here. I
show you,&rdquo; Sam replied, leading the way to one
end of the shed.</p>
<p>He caught up a peck measure and, lifting the
cover of a bin, scooped it about two-thirds full of
oats. The boys noticed that the bin was nearly
empty. He then sat the measure on the top of a
box and began to shake it violently back and forth.
Then, with his hands, he shoveled the oats back in
the bin. As soon as the measure was emptied he
held it out to Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he cried excitedly.</p>
<p>Bob and Jack both looked into the measure and
saw, on the bottom, a thin coating of a fine white
powder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That stuff no should be in der oats,&rdquo; Sam declared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not,&rdquo; Bob agreed, as he touched
the powder with his finger and carefully touched his
tongue to it. &ldquo;You come with me,&rdquo; he cried, leading
the way toward the cook house.</p>
<p>The cook had a roaring fire in the stove, and taking
a pinch of the powder he threw it on to the
hot lid. Instantly a white vapor rose in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; he declared, turning to Sam, who
was standing close by with a puzzled expression on
his face. &ldquo;Now Sam, when I put another bit on
the stove, I want you to get your nose into that
smoke and tell me what it smells like. It won&rsquo;t
hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She smell ver&rsquo; lak garlic,&rdquo; Sam declared a minute
later, and, after a third trial, Jack corroborated
his assertion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles it beyond the shadow of a doubt,&rdquo;
Bob said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s arsenic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m sure. What do you suppose I&rsquo;ve
studied chemistry for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She ver&rsquo; pisen, dat arsenic,&rdquo; Sam declared, shaking
his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it is,&rdquo; Bob said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder they
didn&rsquo;t all die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it seems that we&rsquo;ve found out the how and
now to find the who,&rdquo; Jack said as they returned to
the shed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>By repeating Sam&rsquo;s sifting process Bob secured
about two tablespoons full of the white powder,
which he had declared to be arsenic. This he put in
a small bottle which the cook had given him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you both to remember that you saw me
get this stuff out of these oats,&rdquo; he told Jack and
Sam. &ldquo;If this ever gets to court it will be a mighty
important piece of evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys did not expect Tom back until late at
night, and he had said that he might not return
before the next day. So they cautioned Sam to say
nothing about what they had discovered, thinking
it best to keep the knowledge to themselves until
they had asked Tom&rsquo;s advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But some one must keep watch here all the
time,&rdquo; Bob declared. &ldquo;You see whoever did it may
try it again, and we may get a chance to catch him,
although I doubt it. I hardly think he&rsquo;d dare try
it a second time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam readily agreed to watch through the night,
saying that he would have to be up a good part of
the night anyway to give the horses medicine as
he had the past two nights. He said that he had
had a good long nap that morning and would not
miss the sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>By this time it was beginning to get dark and
they knew that within a few minutes the men would
be coming in from the cutting. So the boys decided
to go to the office and talk over this latest development
while waiting for the supper horn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ought not to be a very difficult matter to
trace that arsenic,&rdquo; Bob declared as he lit the kindling
in the office stove. &ldquo;You see white arsenic is
not very common around here, and if it was bought
in Skowhegan or any other small town, whoever
sold it would be pretty sure to remember it. Of
course if the fellow sent to Boston or to some other
big city for it, it would complicate matters. But
I&rsquo;m counting on the idea that he did not think that
it would be found out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is going to be real detective work, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
Jack said as he filled the stove with wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a job that&rsquo;s apt to take a long time,&rdquo; Bob
declared soberly. &ldquo;You see it means canvassing all
the drug stores within a big radius of here; that is,
unless we hit on the right one early in the game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the horn called them to supper, but as
soon as the meal was over they returned to the
office where they sat and discussed plans until Tom
returned shortly after ten o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What luck?&rdquo; Jack asked, as the foreman pushed
open the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and it&rsquo;s jest as I expected. Nary a horse
fer love nor money. But I got yer father on the
&rsquo;phone and he&rsquo;s a goin&rsquo; ter see what he kin do,&rdquo;
and Tom threw himself into a chair in front of the
stove. &ldquo;And what ye byes bin doin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>They told him, first of their visit to Big Ben, and
the Irishman chuckled with delight as he learned of
the man&rsquo;s discomfiture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ve found out what poisoned the horses,&rdquo;
Jack said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did it?&rdquo; Tom shouted, jumping to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get excited,&rdquo; Jack cautioned, as he pushed
him back into the chair. &ldquo;I said &lsquo;what&rsquo; not &lsquo;who,&rsquo;&rdquo;
and he proceeded to tell him how Bob had found
and proved that it was arsenic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to give Sam a lot of credit for it,&rdquo;
Bob interrupted. &ldquo;It was really he who discovered
the stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam&rsquo;s a mighty fine bye even if he&rsquo;s a breed,&rdquo;
Tom declared. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s meself thot&rsquo;s bettin&rsquo; thot
the rascle won&rsquo;t git anither chance while he&rsquo;s thar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what do you think we&rsquo;d better do, Tom?&rdquo;
Bob asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and thot&rsquo;s hard ter say,&rdquo; Tom answered
reflectively. &ldquo;If we could find out who sold the
stuff and who bought it, we&rsquo;d sure have a bunch o&rsquo;
cir&mdash;cir&mdash;, what the blazes is thot kind o&rsquo; ividence
when yer don&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo; but think yer know it
all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you mean circumstantial evidence,&rdquo; Bob
laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and thot&rsquo;s the woid,&rdquo; and both Tom and
Jack joined in the laughter at the former&rsquo;s expense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we could find the bottle or box, or whatever
the stuff was in, it would probably help a lot,&rdquo; Bob
suggested. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t suppose there&rsquo;s much hope
of that,&rdquo; he added mournfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the mane skunk probably dumped the whole
of it in and took the bottle away wid him,&rdquo; Tom
agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Father say when he would be up?&rdquo; Jack
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not fer sartin sure, but as soon as he could git
away, in a day or two he said,&rdquo; Tom replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you think it would be a good plan
to wait till he comes and see what he thinks about
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re right. A day or two probably
won&rsquo;t make much difference one way or the other,
and if we do the wrong thing we might make a bad
matter worse,&rdquo; Bob replied, and Tom nodded his
head in agreement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XI.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">BIG BEN FALLS DOWN AGAIN.</span></h2>
<p>It was pitch dark in the bunk house when Bob
awoke. Unless disturbed it was an unusual thing
for him to wake up before time to get up, so, expecting
every minute to hear the rising horn, he lay
for a few minutes in a half doze. Finally, as the
call did not come, he glanced at his wrist watch, and
with a start of surprise saw that it was only two
o&rsquo;clock. With a sigh of relief, for he was still
sleepy, he turned over and closed his eyes, expecting
to be asleep in another minute. But to his surprise,
he continued to keep awake. He wondered
how the sick horses were and if his father would
be able to find others to take their places until they
were able to work again. Then he fell to wondering
what Big Ben would try next in his efforts to
delay their work.</p>
<p>A half hour passed and still he could not sleep.
Finally, when the luminous dial told him that he
had been awake a full hour, he resolved to get up
and join Sam in the horse shed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use lying here awake,&rdquo; he thought,
as he slid from his bunk to the floor, and very quietly,
so as not to disturb anyone, began pulling on
his clothes. This done, he groped his way to the
door, and opening it carefully stepped out into the
night. It was very cold, &ldquo;thirty below at least,&rdquo; he
thought, as he pulled the door shut. The night was
clear, and stars, which thickly studded the heavens,
gave a faint cold light which enabled him to see
dimly for some distance. For a moment he stood
drinking in the beauty of the night and filling his
lungs with the spruce scented air. Then he turned
toward the shed, but at that moment he happened
to glance at the office. With a sudden start of
amazement, he noticed that the door was part way
open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s mighty strange,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;But perhaps
Tom couldn&rsquo;t sleep either and has gone out to
see how the horses are. At any rate I&rsquo;ll know in a
minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He found Sam half asleep in a chair in front of
the little stove at one end of the long shed. He
sprang up as the boy pushed open the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it be you, oui,&rdquo; he said, relieved as the light
of a lantern which hung on the wall back of him
disclosed his visitor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s I all right,&rdquo; Bob replied. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
sleep so I thought I&rsquo;d come out and see how the
patients are getting along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them get long ver&rsquo; weel. No so much seek
now,&rdquo; Sam assured him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Tom?&rdquo; Bob asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nicht, not after he come back bout ten,&rdquo; Sam
replied. &ldquo;What mak&rsquo; you tink I see heem?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the door of the office was open and I
thought probably he was out here with you,&rdquo; and
a worried look sprang to Bob&rsquo;s face which Sam was
quick to notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat ver&rsquo; queer, she be open dis cold night.
We go see bout eet,&rdquo; and Sam quickly slipped into
his heavy mackinaw and grabbed his cap from a
nail in the wall.</p>
<p>They were about half way across the clearing
when two men stepped out of the office door. In
the dim light they could only see their forms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; Bob gasped, as he caught
Sam by the arm.</p>
<p>Sam did not stop to reply, but snatching his arm
away, started for the office on the run. At that
moment the men saw them, and darting around the
corner they made for the river at the top of their
speed.</p>
<p>On reaching the office, Sam stopped and waited
for Bob, who was a few feet behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We go geet &rsquo;em, oui?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. Let them go,&rdquo; Bob replied, shaking his
head. &ldquo;I doubt if we could catch them and it
wouldn&rsquo;t be safe. They&rsquo;re probably armed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam gave a grunt of disappointment, but evidently
realizing that what Bob had said was true,
he made no further comment but followed him into
the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello Tom,&rdquo; Bob shouted, as soon as they were
inside.</p>
<p>At first there was no reply, but as they listened
a low muffled grunt came from the little bed room.
By this time Sam had the light lit and they hurried
into the other room. A low cry of anger burst from
Bob&rsquo;s lips as he saw the foreman lying tied hand
and foot, on the bed, and gagged with a big red
handkerchief. Quickly getting out his knife, he
soon freed him and Tom sat up with a sheepish look
on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt, Tom?&rdquo; Bob asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nary a hurt but to me falings,&rdquo; Tom grinned,
as he slowly got to his feet. &ldquo;But did yer see &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we saw them all right, but they had the
start of us and I didn&rsquo;t think it safe to try to catch
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and it&rsquo;s a good thing yer didn&rsquo;t. They are
as strong as an ox,&rdquo; Tom declared, rubbing his
ankles to restore the circulation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up and tell us what happened,&rdquo; Bob
urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and I&rsquo;ll do that same. I was slaping as
swately as a babe, when all of a sudden I felt the
kivers yanked off me and before I could get me
bearings the villains had me hands tied fast and me
fate too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m mighty glad they didn&rsquo;t hurt you, but
you&rsquo;d better get back into bed or you&rsquo;ll get your
death. It&rsquo;s colder than Greenland in here and then
some,&rdquo; Bob declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and I&rsquo;ll be after gitting me clothes on. No
more slape fer me this night,&rdquo; and he began quickly
to pull on his trowsers.</p>
<p>While he was dressing, Bob and Sam stepped out
into the office. As he expected, Bob saw at once
that the door of the little safe was wide open. The
safe had a combination lock, but as it seldom held
anything of value it was usually left unlocked.
That it had been thoroughly searched was evident,
as a number of papers were scattered over the floor
in front of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there any money in the safe?&rdquo; Bob called
to Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nary a dollar,&rdquo; the foreman replied, as he joined
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I guess they didn&rsquo;t get anything of value.
Of course they were after that deed. Isn&rsquo;t it lucky
that we sent it down to Greenville by Jacques?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tink dat ver&rsquo; bon idea,&rdquo; Sam declared, and
Tom heartily agreed with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know who they were?&rdquo; Bob asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nary a bit. Sure and they had handkerchiefs
over their faces and not a woid did they spake thot
I could hear,&rdquo; Tom explained as he started to build
a fire in the stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad we couldn&rsquo;t have recognized them,&rdquo;
Bob sighed, as he held out his hands to the stove
which was already radiating heat through the room.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got nothing but suspicion to go on again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam, saying that he had better get back and see
to the horses, soon left the office and Bob, after
picking up the papers and putting them back in the
safe, got out the checker board and soon they were
deeply interested in the game. So intent were they
that it seemed but a few minutes before the rising
horn told them that in ten minutes breakfast would
be on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and we&rsquo;ll have ter finish this game, breakfast
or no breakfast,&rdquo; Tom declared as he jumped
one of Bob&rsquo;s kings. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s meself as thinks thot I got
yer in a hole this time,&rdquo; and a few minutes later
Bob had to acknowledge that he was right and with
a grin the foreman made a mark on his side of a bit
of paper on which he kept a record of all the games.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yee&rsquo;re only two ahead now,&rdquo; he declared, as he
put the paper carefully away in the drawer of the
table.</p>
<p>After breakfast was over Bob told Jack what had
happened, but cautioned him to keep the information
to himself, for the present at least.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plot thickens,&rdquo; Jack whispered dramatically,
as Bob finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if it gets much thicker I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ll
be all clogged up,&rdquo; Bob smiled, but, as Jack declared,
it was a serious sort of a smile.</p>
<p>As they had decided to take no steps until they
had talked with their father, they joined the men at
the cutting and were soon busy sawing down a big
spruce. The logs, owing to the horses being sick,
had accumulated during the past two days, and all
about them were piles which were steadily growing
larger. The one team which was available was
doing its best to keep the big logs moving, but their
efforts seemed puny when compared with what was
needed.</p>
<p>The boys had been working but a few minutes
when Tom joined them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and we&rsquo;ll soon be all clogged up here,&rdquo; he
declared as he surveyed the ever growing piles.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a half a mind to begin cuttin&rsquo; on the big tract.
Yer know it runs down close ter the lake and we
could cut thar fer two or three days wid no hauling
necessary at all. It would give Jim time ter
catch up wid his job here a bit. What do yez think
about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it would mean a fight with Big Ben,&rdquo;
Bob said slowly, as he took off his cap to wipe his
forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of it?&rdquo; Jack asked impulsively. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet
we could lick &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think about it yourself, Tom?&rdquo;
Bob asked, ignoring his brother&rsquo;s remark, much to
Jack&rsquo;s disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I dunno,&rdquo; and the big Irishman scratched
his head reflectively. &ldquo;Mebby he&rsquo;d foight and then
again mebby he wouldn&rsquo;t. Sure and it&rsquo;s about a
toss up I&rsquo;m a thinkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might make a start at it, and if we see that
he means to fight we could take back water I suppose,&rdquo;
Bob said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk, all but that back water stuff,&rdquo;
Jack broke in joyously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s worth tryin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Tom said, &ldquo;but we
won&rsquo;t change till after dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the noon meal Tom explained the plan to
the men and warned them that, in case Big Ben and
his crew should interfere, there was to be no fighting
unless he should give the word.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>As has been stated, the edge of the disputed track
came nearly to the clearing, and they hoped that by
cutting only on the upper end that they might get
in two or three day&rsquo;s work before Ben learned of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never know a thing about it unless someone
happens to go by and tells him,&rdquo; Jack declared
as he and Bob followed the crew to the new cutting.</p>
<p>Here the big spruces grew close to the edge of
the lake, and as Tom had said no hauling would be
necessary for several days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder Ben tried to get possession of this
lot,&rdquo; Bob declared as he looked up at the towering
trees, their trunks reaching far up as straight as an
arrow. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be hardly a bit of waste to these
trees,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>The men fell to with a will and by the time the
first hint of the approaching night stole over the
forest, Tom vowed that they had cut not less than
twenty thousand feet.</p>
<p>That evening Bob and Tom had just completed
a draw game when a heavy knock sounded on the
door of the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; Tom shouted.</p>
<p>The door immediately swung open and Big Ben
Donahue entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fine avenin&rsquo; to yez,&rdquo; Tom said, getting up and
waving his visitor to a chair near the stove.</p>
<p>That Big Ben was mad and meant trouble was
plain to be seen. He paid no attention to the greeting
nor did he accept the chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know what you mean by cutting on
my property,&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and I&rsquo;d like ter know who&rsquo;s been a cuttin&rsquo;
on yer property. I hain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Tom replied in a pleasant
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, what&rsquo;s the use of lying about it. You&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he got no farther for Tom stepped toward
him and there was that in the Irishman&rsquo;s eyes
which caused the big man to stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on thar right what ye are. I&rsquo;m Irish clean
ter the bone and the man don&rsquo;t live thot can call
me thot and get away wid it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Big Ben said hastily. &ldquo;No offense
intended, but you know that you&rsquo;ve been cuttin&rsquo; on
the tract just below here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and now yer&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo; so&rsquo;s I kin understand
yer. I did start ter cuttin&rsquo; on the tract jest
forninst here. What about it?&rdquo; and Tom resumed
his seat, leaving the other standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This about it,&rdquo; the big man snapped. &ldquo;I own
that piece of timber and I warn ye to keep off it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I told you yesterday, Mr. Donahue,&rdquo; Bob
broke in, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got a paper which says that the
tract belongs to Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as I told ye then, I tell ye now, that I don&rsquo;t
believe a word of it. Of course,&rdquo; he hastened to
add, as he noticed the red blood mounting to Tom&rsquo;s
face, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt but that you&rsquo;ve got a paper
which you think proves it, but just the same the
property is mine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thot&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; Bob heard the Irishman mutter
as he twisted uneasily in his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can prove that in court, of course all the
timber which we cut on the tract will belong to you,
so you will not lose anything no matter how much
we get down,&rdquo; Bob explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the point,&rdquo; Ben broke in angrily. &ldquo;I
tell ye the land&rsquo;s mine and I forbid ye to cut another
tree on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if we do?&rdquo; Bob asked in even tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive ye off,&rdquo; and the big man evidently
meant what he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Bob said dryly. &ldquo;I just wanted to be
sure where we stand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess ye know now,&rdquo; the other snapped.</p>
<p>For a moment no one spoke; then, as if he had
come to a definite conclusion, Bob said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Donahue, we do not wish to have trouble
with you if it can be avoided, but you have already
gone too far. Now,&rdquo; as the man was about to interrupt,
&ldquo;let me finish and then we&rsquo;ll listen to what you
have to say. Last summer Father beat you in a
fair bid for the contract with the Great Northern
Star Company, and you have been doing your best to
try to delay our work. First you tried to scare our
men with a ghost, then you got some of them drunk,
and finally you, or someone in your employ, put arsenic
in our oats and killed two of our horses.&rdquo; Bob
was sorry the minute he mentioned the arsenic, but
it was too late now and he went on. &ldquo;And only last
night two men burglarized the safe here, but they
didn&rsquo;t get what they were after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; the big man began, his face red
with anger, but he stopped short as Tom rose from
his chair. &ldquo;I had nothing to do with all that,&rdquo; he
substituted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll let that pass for the present, as
we are not in a position to prove it, that is just
now,&rdquo; Bob added, with strong emphasis on the last
two words.</p>
<p>Big Ben Donahue was getting all the worst of
the argument, and he had sense enough to know it,
but it was not in his nature to give up so long as he
had a foot on which to stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use to multiply words about it,&rdquo; he declared,
buttoning up his mackinaw. &ldquo;But I warn
ye once more not to cut another stick on that property,
and if ye do I&rsquo;ll make ye wish that ye hadn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
and with a savage scowl he was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pleasant company, isn&rsquo;t he,&rdquo; Bob remarked with
a smile, as he began to arrange the men on the
checker board.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;He was bluffing and he knew it,&rdquo; Jack declared,
picking up the book which he had been reading
when Big Ben came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebby,&rdquo; Bob agreed. &ldquo;But the big question is,
does his bluff go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not any,&rdquo; Jack replied quickly, but Tom shook
his head slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and it&rsquo;s meself as knows the kind of a gang
he&rsquo;s got. If he brings &rsquo;em up here somebody&rsquo;ll git
a broken head or two, and it&rsquo;s meself as doubts if
the game&rsquo;s worth it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you how we can fix it,&rdquo; Jack declared
suddenly, throwing his book on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Spring it,&rdquo; Bob said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why not do this? In the morning the
men can go to work right where they left off. You
and I&rsquo;ll go down about a mile toward Ben&rsquo;s camp
and watch. If we see them coming we can give a
signal and long before they can get here the men
can all be at work on the other side of the clearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and it&rsquo;s a foin head ye got,&rdquo; and the foreman
cast an admiring glance at the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe he&rsquo;s struck it,&rdquo; Bob agreed, giving his
brother a hearty slap on the back. &ldquo;And if you
agree, Tom, we&rsquo;ll try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and it&rsquo;s jest the ticket,&rdquo; Tom said as he
took the checker board from the table. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your
foist move.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>The game was hardly started, however, when the
door was pushed open without warning and Jacques
Lamont stepped in to the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Jacques,&rdquo; shouted both the boys, springing
to their feet, Bob forgetting that he had one
side of the checker board on his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, thar, will yez look ter what yer after
doing,&rdquo; Tom called, as the checker men slid to the
floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Tom,&rdquo; Bob apologized. &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll
have to begin that game all over again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And jest when I had one illegant start on yer,&rdquo;
Tom grumbled as he too got to his feet and gave
the Frenchman a hearty welcome.</p>
<p>After the exchange of greetings, Jacques told
them that he was going back to Canada to finish
out the season trapping, and hoped to get together
another good load before spring. But, on being
urged by the boys and Tom, he agreed to spend a
couple of days with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tink I mak beeg lot money thees winter,&rdquo; he
said, as he pulled off his heavy mackinaw.</p>
<p>Tom and Bob had to start their game over again,
and much to the former&rsquo;s disgust Bob skunked
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and I&rsquo;ll niver git another start like thot
one I had when you knocked all the men on the
floor,&rdquo; he declared as he started to place the men
for a new game.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>As soon as the work was well under way the next
morning, the boys fastened on their snow-shoes and
started off toward the other camp. Fortunately the
weather had turned warm, and in the bright sun
the snow began to melt. As soon as they had covered
about a mile, they stopped and looked around
for a good hiding place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must get somewhere where we can see out
on the lake as well as in the woods,&rdquo; Bob declared.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re about as apt to come one way as the
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally Jack spied a big pine with particularly
thick branches, and removing his snow-shoes he
was soon two-thirds of the way to the top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you see out on the lake?&rdquo; Bob called from
beneath the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure can,&rdquo; Jack called back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right then, come on down and I&rsquo;ll hand the
shoes to you and then I&rsquo;ll be with you. I can&rsquo;t see
a thing of you, so I guess it&rsquo;ll be a good thing all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty glad it isn&rsquo;t cold,&rdquo; Jack declared, as
they settled themselves as comfortably as possible
in the branches of the tree. &ldquo;We may have to wait
here a good while, and if it was thirty or forty
below it wouldn&rsquo;t be very pleasant, let me tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>An hour passed. The boys spent the time in talking
over the situation and forming tentative plans
for the immediate future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;S-S&mdash;h, someone&rsquo;s coming,&rdquo; Jack suddenly
whispered, as his quick ears caught the sound of
a low whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see him,&rdquo; Bob said a moment later, peering
through the branches. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s that fellow that
had the jug the other day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man, swinging swiftly along on his snowshoes,
passed directly beneath the tree in which they
were concealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going up to see if we&rsquo;re cutting on the
tract,&rdquo; Jack declared as soon as he was out of sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; Bob agreed. &ldquo;If he is he&rsquo;ll be back
in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s prediction was correct, for in less than a
half hour they sighted the man returning and it was
evident, from the speed he was making, that he
was in a great hurry to get back to the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had we better go back and tell Tom?&rdquo; Jack
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d better wait till we&rsquo;re sure they are
coming,&rdquo; Bob replied after a moment&rsquo;s thought.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to give a false alarm and it may
be that Ben has an entirely different plan.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>So they waited another hour and had about concluded
that the enemy did not intend to make the
attack, when the distant sound of voices reached
their ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe they&rsquo;re coming,&rdquo; Bob said, straining
his ears to the utmost to learn if they were approaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re coming all right,&rdquo; he declared a
moment later, as the voices came decidedly nearer.
&ldquo;And, by the sound, there&rsquo;s a lot of them,&rdquo; and
drawing a whistle from his pocket, he put it to his
lips and blew with all his strength.</p>
<p>Almost immediately a faint whistle was heard
from the direction of their camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He heard us all right,&rdquo; Bob declared, as he returned
the whistle to his pocket. &ldquo;Now we want
to get back just as soon as our legs will take us
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As rapidly as possible they scrambled down to
the ground, and fastening on their snow-shoes
started off at a swinging trot, a pace which, on
snow-shoes, covers ground with almost unbelievable
speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as we really need to hurry so after
all,&rdquo; Bob panted, after they had covered about half
the distance back. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t likely that many of
them have snow-shoes, and they won&rsquo;t be able to
make much speed without them. Can you hear
anything?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>For a moment they stood still and listened. Very
faintly the murmur of voices reached their ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty of time,&rdquo; Bob decided, as he
started off again at a more moderate pace.</p>
<p>In a few minutes they reached the clearing and
as Bob glanced at the place where the men had been
at work when they had left a few hours before, he
gave vent to a low chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet it&rsquo;ll be a surprise to Ben when he doesn&rsquo;t
find a soul here,&rdquo; he said as he started across the
clearing toward the former cutting.</p>
<p>Tom met them just as they came in sight of the
crew, busily at work, &ldquo;as though they had never cut
anywhere else and never intended to,&rdquo; Jack laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they&rsquo;re a comin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Tom greeted them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They sure are, the whole kerboodle of them I
guess,&rdquo; Jack replied as he kicked the snow-shoes
from his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t wait to see how many there were,&rdquo;
Bob explained. &ldquo;But we could hear them and I
guess Jack&rsquo;s about right. Listen. They can&rsquo;t be
very far away now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But although they strained their ears, not a sound
reached them from the direction of the rival camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and they probably cut out the talkin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
Tom said. &ldquo;I gess they mane ter take us by surprise
as it was, but it&rsquo;s meself as thinks the surprise
will be on the ither foot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>It was a full half hour later when they caught
the first glimpse of the &ldquo;invading army,&rdquo; as Jack
termed them. They appeared suddenly in the
woods on the other side of the clearing, full fifty
strong. Only a few were equipped with snow-shoes,
and that was undoubtedly why they had been so
long in getting there. Every man had a club of
some kind in his hand, but the boys were unable to
see any guns. Big Ben was too well acquainted
with the type of man he employed to trust them
with anything more deadly than an ax handle or a
broken peavey.</p>
<p>They stopped on the edge of the clearing as if
undecided as to the next move. The fact that there
was no one working on the disputed tract when they
arrived had evidently disarranged their plans.</p>
<p>From their position, just within the fringe of
trees which separated the camp from the place
where the crew was at work, Tom and the boys
watched, trying to catch sight of Big Ben. The
men were talking excitedly but in low tones, so that
they were unable to catch what was being said, but
from their wild gesticulations they judged that
many of them were urging an immediate attack on
the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see him,&rdquo; Jack whispered, as they all saw the
big man shouldering his way through the mob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>As he stepped out into the clearing, he stopped
and faced his men, and it was evident to the watchers
that he was giving them orders, but he spoke too
low for them to hear what he said. He talked only
a moment and then started across the open space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on. We&rsquo;ll go mate him,&rdquo; Tom said, as he
stepped out from behind a big spruce and closely
followed by the boys advanced to meet him. With
a face as black as a thunder cloud, the big man came
to within six feet of them before he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you thought you&rsquo;d better quit, hey?&rdquo; he
sneered, as he came to a halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye kin put it thot way if ye wish,&rdquo; Tom replied
in a sharp tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s a mighty lucky thing for you that ye
did quit. If ye hadn&rsquo;t ye&rsquo;d have been made to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebby and mebby not,&rdquo; Tom grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d advise ye to keep a civil tongue in your head
or the fact that ye got cold feet may not do any
good. It isn&rsquo;t too late for a fight yet, and my boys
are spoiling for one,&rdquo; and the big man nodded his
head in the direction of his crew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a moment, Mr. Donahue,&rdquo; Bob broke in as
the man was about to continue. &ldquo;We do not wish
to have any trouble and that is the reason that we
stopped cutting on that tract. But you will agree
that this piece of land belongs to Father, and if any
of your men step foot on it we shall hold you responsible.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;Responsible be hanged,&rdquo; Big Ben snorted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
have you to understand that I go where I like, and
take my men with me too. Now ye say ye don&rsquo;t
want to fight. Well, there&rsquo;s jest one way ye can get
around it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By giving me your word that you&rsquo;ll cut no more
timber on that tract.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thin, begorra, it&rsquo;s meself thot gesses there&rsquo;ll
have ter be a fight after all,&rdquo; Tom declared with a
grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that your answer?&rdquo; Big Ben asked, looking
at Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; Bob replied slowly. &ldquo;For how
long a time do you expect us to keep off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till I tell ye that ye can go ahead,&rdquo; he snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s too indefinite,&rdquo; Bob asserted
firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then ye refuse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll have to,&rdquo; Bob replied sadly.
&ldquo;But I warn you once more that you will be held
responsible if there is any trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Big Ben made no reply but turned and waved his
hand, evidently a prearranged signal. The sign was
greeted with a loud chorus of yells, and the mob,
brandishing their clubs, charged forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>At that moment Bob put his hand to his mouth
and a shrill whistle sounded through the forest.
Instantly six men, led by Jacques Lamont and Jean
Lareau, stepped into sight, and each man carried in
his hands a Winchester.</p>
<p>At the sound of the whistle the crowd paused
and at the sight of the six determined looking men
they came to a full halt. Big Ben&rsquo;s face was a puzzle
as he saw the turn things had taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what&mdash;do you mean?&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We mean to prevent murder,&rdquo; Bob answered
sternly. &ldquo;Our men, except these six, have only
their axes with which to fight, and you know what
that would mean in case your men got to them. As
I said before, we do not want trouble, but if any of
your men come any nearer I&rsquo;m afraid those rifles
will have something to say about it. Remember
you are on our land.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">BIG BEN DECIDES THAT HE HAD BETTER NOT.</span></h2>
<p>For a moment Big Ben paused as if undecided
what to say, and before he could come to a decision
the sound of sleigh bells was heard, and, glancing
quickly around, the boys were overjoyed to see
their father just turning into the clearing in a light
cutter drawn by a spirited bay. Mr. Golden was
driving and by his side sat Sheriff Switzer. As Big
Ben saw the two men he started toward his crew,
but, evidently changing his mind, he stopped after
taking a few steps, and turned back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all the rumpus here?&rdquo; Mr. Golden cried
as he handed the reins to the sheriff and sprang
from the sleigh. &ldquo;Hello Ben,&rdquo; he added, as though
he had just noticed the man. &ldquo;What seems to be
the main difficulty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your men have been cuttin&rsquo; on my land, that&rsquo;s
what&rsquo;s the mater,&rdquo; the man growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean it,&rdquo; Mr. Golden said, and turning
to Tom he asked:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>&ldquo;How about it, Tom? That&rsquo;s a pretty serious
accusation,&rdquo; he said gravely, but as he spoke the
boys caught sight of a well known twinkle in their
father&rsquo;s eye which told them that he was not blaming
them for what had been done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and if he owns thot strip,&rdquo; and Tom waved
his hand in the direction of the disputed tract,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re guilty all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the papers what says I own it,&rdquo; Big
Ben shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so have I,&rdquo; Mr. Golden declared, more quietly
but no less firmly. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t the boys tell you
that my deed had been found?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;posin&rsquo; they did, that don&rsquo;t make it so. I say
the land is mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, I see there&rsquo;s no use in arguing about
it now. We&rsquo;ll have the court settle that question
at the next term. Meanwhile I&rsquo;m sure there is no
reason why we should have trouble. You&rsquo;ve cut on
the tract and it seems that we have done the same.
If the court says the land is yours then the timber
which we have cut belongs to you, and the same the
other way round. That&rsquo;s fair, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; and Mr.
Golden glanced at the sheriff, who nodded his head.</p>
<p>But Big Ben, evidently realizing that the argument
was going against him, had already turned
away and was walking rapidly toward his men. He
said a few words to them in a tone too low to be
heard by the boys, and after a short pause the mob
turned and soon disappeared in the woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>&ldquo;You sure came in the nick of time,&rdquo; Bob declared
as he shook hands with his father and the
sheriff. &ldquo;Those fellows were just in the right mood
for a fight and it&rsquo;s hard telling how long we could
have held them off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem pretty well fortified,&rdquo; Mr. Golden
laughed as he turned to the six men with the rifles
and shook hands with each of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to see you, Jacques,&rdquo; he added, as he
welcomed the big trapper. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ve had a
good season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ver&rsquo; bon merci,&rdquo; Jacques replied with a bright
smile. &ldquo;I bring down one beeg load ver&rsquo; fine pelt.
Mebby geet &rsquo;nother fore spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, by the way, Tom, I managed to scare up
four horses for you and they ought to be along in an
hour or two,&rdquo; Mr. Golden said, turning to the foreman.
&ldquo;How are the sick ones? Did you find out
what&rsquo;s the matter with them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come into the office and we&rsquo;ll tell you all about
it,&rdquo; Bob broke in. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite a long story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving the horse to be taken care of by one of
the men, Mr. Golden and Mr. Switzer followed
Tom and the boys into the office, where a good fire
was roaring in the stove.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s have the story,&rdquo; Mr. Golden smiled,
as they removed their overcoats and sat down.</p>
<p>For some minutes Bob talked rapidly, telling
them all that had happened. No one interrupted
him, and when he had finished the sheriff, as if he
could hold in no longer, exploded with:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dirty rascal. I never would have believed
that Ben would do as mean a thing as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; Mr. Golden agreed. &ldquo;Of course I knew
that he was pretty sore over losing that contract, but
I did not think that he would poison my horses.
He ought to be punished for that. I could overlook
all his other tricks to try to hold us back, but he&rsquo;s
gone a bit too far,&rdquo; and he shook his head gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve got to prove that he did it first,&rdquo; Jack
said as he put a big chunk of wood in the stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m afraid that will be a hard thing to do,&rdquo;
his father declared. &ldquo;You see it&rsquo;s against the law
for a druggist to sell arsenic, and for that reason
whoever sold it to him is not going to own up to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about doing any more cutting on that
strip?&rdquo; Bob asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d better risk it,&rdquo; his father
answered after a moment&rsquo;s thought. &ldquo;It would
probably end in a fight and it isn&rsquo;t worth it. Court
sits week after next and I&rsquo;ll have the matter settled
then.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>They talked matters over until the dinner horn
sounded. Mr. Golden said that he and Mr. Switzer
would have to leave soon after dinner in order to
catch the afternoon train for Skowhegan, as he had
to attend an important directors&rsquo; meeting at the
bank the next morning.</p>
<p>The four horses arrived soon after the two men
left, and the following morning saw three teams
hard at work trying to catch up on the hauling.
The sick horses were rapidly recovering, and Sam
declared that they would be able to work in a day
or two.</p>
<p>All that day the two boys worked with the crew
cutting down the big spruce trees, rejoicing in the
thought that every one added to those already cut,
brought their father so much nearer to the fulfillment
of his contract. It had been moderating all
day, and toward nightfall it began to rain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like we&rsquo;re in fer a thaw,&rdquo; Tom declared
as they entered the mess room for supper.</p>
<p>Soon the rain was coming down in a steady pour,
which lasted until about eight o&rsquo;clock, when the
wind shifted into the northwest and the mercury
began to fall rapidly. In another half hour the rain
had ceased, and with a sigh of relief Tom stepped
to the door of the office and glanced at the thermometer
hanging just outside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>&ldquo;Faith and she&rsquo;s tumbled twenty degrees in the
last hour,&rdquo; he declared, coming back into the room.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be one peach of a crust in the mornin&rsquo; I&rsquo;m
thinkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day was Sunday and the boys had decided
to get an early start and spend the day with
their Indian friend, Kernertok.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; Jack shouted, when, just as day was
breaking the next morning, he rushed out of the
bunk house, closely followed by Bob. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
crust strong enough to hold a horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was many degrees below zero, and as he had
declared, the surface of the snow was frozen solid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really believe we can skate on it,&rdquo; Bob asserted
as he slid about on the smooth surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we can,&rdquo; Jack agreed eagerly. &ldquo;And
it&rsquo;s mighty lucky we brought our skates with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a hurried breakfast they got their skates
from the office and quickly exchanging their moccasins
for shoes they were soon skimming over the
surface of the lake on their way to Kernertok&rsquo;s
cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost as good as ice to skate on,&rdquo; Jack
declared, and his brother agreed with him.</p>
<p>Thanks to the crust they reached the cabin much
sooner than they had expected and found Kernertok
eating his breakfast. Kernertok was very glad to
see them, as was also Sicum, his faithful dog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>The day passed quickly, as days spent with him
always did, and almost before they were aware of it,
it was time to start for the camp.</p>
<p>As they skated along side by side, with long
swinging strokes which bore them rapidly over the
surface of the lake, Bob said suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, boy, we&rsquo;ve got to prove that Ben Donahue
poisoned those horses. If we don&rsquo;t he&rsquo;ll find some
way to hold the crew up long enough to make father
forfeit that contract. But if we can prove that he
did it, we&rsquo;ll have a club to hold over him and can
make him be good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were only about a mile from the camp as
Bob spoke, and, as if by one impulse, both stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, of course,&rdquo; Jack said as he stooped
to tighten a strap. &ldquo;But how are we going to do it?
You remember what father said about it being next
to impossible to find out where he got the stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember it all right, but I&rsquo;ve been thinking
about it all day and I believe there&rsquo;s a chance. It&rsquo;s
a mighty slim one, I&rsquo;ll admit, but it&rsquo;s a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, spring it,&rdquo; Jack said eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s like this. He must have had the arsenic
either in a bottle or a box, and if we could find
it, it might tell us what we want to know. Now he
either threw it away or else he took it back with
him, and I&rsquo;m counting on his having taken it back
to his office. You know in some ways he&rsquo;s rather
stupid, though smart enough in others.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I get what you&rsquo;re driving at,&rdquo; Jack declared
as Bob paused. &ldquo;You mean that it&rsquo;s up to us
to search his office for that bottle, hey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You guessed it the first time,&rdquo; Bob smiled.
&ldquo;What do you think of the idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty risky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granted; and what&rsquo;s more, not likely to be successful,&rdquo;
Bob agreed. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a chance. Anything
better to offer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to throw any cold water on the
plan,&rdquo; Jack assured him with a smile. &ldquo;I really like
the idea, and as you say it&rsquo;s the only way that even
has a hint of success. I&rsquo;ve always thought I&rsquo;d make
a dandy burglar. When do we make the try?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sooner the better, I&rsquo;d say. How about tomorrow
night? I don&rsquo;t want to do it on the Sabbath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow night it is then,&rdquo; Jack agreed without
hesitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word to a soul, even to Tom,&rdquo; Bob cautioned.
&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t let us go if he knew it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They reached the camp just in time for supper,
and as soon as the meal was over Bob got his guitar
and for nearly two hours the room rang with the
music of the old hymns.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>The cold weather continued and the next day the
horses which had been sick were again put to work,
and at quitting time that night the teams had caught
up with the work and the last log felled was loaded
on to a sled just as the supper horn sounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I fale better,&rdquo; Tom declared as he led the
way to the mess house.</p>
<p>It was shortly after ten o&rsquo;clock that night when
the chorus of snores in the bunk house struck the
key, as Bob afterward told Jack, which assured him
that all the men were asleep. Jack occupied the
bunk directly over them and as he had been conscious
of no movement &ldquo;on the upper deck&rdquo; for the
past thirty minutes, he guessed that his brother had
fallen asleep. Reaching up, he gave the slats a push,
and immediately a low whisper assured him that he
had misjudged him.</p>
<p>Very quietly the two boys slid to the floor and
started pulling on their clothing, and a few minutes
later they were sitting on the steps of the office fastening
on their skates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, but it sure is cold,&rdquo; Jack declared, as he
pulled his heavy mittens on to his nearly numbed
hands. &ldquo;Thirty-five below,&rdquo; he announced a moment
later, as he glanced at the thermometer by the
light of his pocket flash.</p>
<p>It was very dark, as there was no moon and a
slight haze rendered the stars all but invisible, although
now and then bright streaks lighted up the
sky as the weird Northern lights sent their mysterious
streamers up and down the heavens.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>&ldquo;There, I guess we&rsquo;re about ready to start,&rdquo; Bob
declared, as he thrust a pair of soft doeskin moccasins
in his pocket.</p>
<p>But just at that moment Jack laid his hand on
his brother&rsquo;s arm with a low hist of warning. His
sharp ears had caught the sound of crackling snow
crust off to the right. Hastily he unlaced his shoes
and, slipping them off with the skates still attached,
he substituted a pair of moccasins similar to the
ones his brother had put in his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Bob, I&rsquo;ll be right back. I just
heard a noise off there in the direction of the bunk
house and I&rsquo;m going to see what it was,&rdquo; and he
glided away in the darkness with noiseless steps,
while Bob, with his skates still on, hobbled into the
office, where it was comparatively warm.</p>
<p>Ten minutes passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what&rsquo;s keeping him,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>Five more minutes went by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he don&rsquo;t come in another five minutes I&rsquo;ll go
look him up,&rdquo; Bob declared half out loud.</p>
<p>The five minutes slipped away and no Jack came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope he hasn&rsquo;t got into trouble,&rdquo; he thought, as
he also quickly substituted moccasins for the heavy
shoes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>Outside the door he stood and strained his ears.
A light wind swayed the tops of the pines and
spruces with a faint moaning sound, but otherwise
perfect silence reigned throughout the deep forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said over by the bunk house,&rdquo; he muttered,
as he started off in that direction, making not the
slightest sound as his moccasined feet struck the
snow.</p>
<p>In a moment the rough side of the bunk house
loomed out of the darkness directly in front of him,
and again he stopped and listened. No sound came
to tell him what had become of his brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty funny,&rdquo; he thought, as he turned the
corner of the building and groped his way step by
step along the back.</p>
<p>As he neared the other corner he stumbled over
an object lying on the snow. A flash from his light
showed him that it was a gallon oil can. He picked
it up and, unscrewing the top, smelled of the contents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gasoline,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Now I wonder what
that&rsquo;s doing out here.&rdquo; And then the thought
struck him that he did not remember ever having
seen a can of that kind anywhere about the camp.
Throwing the light of his flash about him, he
eagerly searched for tracks, but the surface of the
snow was as hard as ice and he could see nothing
which gave him the slightest clue. Carrying the
can in his hand, he crept around the building until
he had made a complete circuit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I know just as much as when I started,&rdquo;
he thought as he listened again. &ldquo;One thing is sure
though,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Something has happened
or Jack would have been back long before this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After waiting a moment in deep thought, he decided
that he had better go back to the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may have turned off and came around another
way and be waiting for me all the time,&rdquo; he
thought.</p>
<p>But the hope was vain for, as he approached the
little office, no answer came to his low whistle.</p>
<p>He had brought the oil can with him, and having
stepped inside the door he examined it more closely
by the aid of his flash. It was a very ordinary can
and he had about given up the hope of obtaining a
clue from it, when his eye caught sight of two letters
in the tin near the bottom. B. D. he made out,
and a slight shudder passed down his back as a horrible
thought struck him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;B. D. stands for Ben Donahue. Someone came
here with that can of gas intending to set fire to the
bunk house,&rdquo; flashed through his mind, as he stood
rooted to the spot. &ldquo;Jack must have discovered him
or them and they gave it up. But what have they
done with Jack?&rdquo; And another shudder shook him
as he realized that the boy was probably in the
power of someone who was desperate enough to
set fire to a building in which many men were
sleeping.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do? What can I do?&rdquo; were the
questions which flashed through his mind over and
over again.</p>
<p>And then a sudden feeling of hope came to him
as he remembered that Jacques Lamont was there,
and in almost no time he was inside the bunk house
creeping softly toward the farther end where he
knew Jacques was sleeping. He thought he knew
the right bunk and as he reached the end of the
room a flash showed him that he was right. The
Frenchman was in a lower bunk and kneeling on the
floor Bob put his lips as close as possible to his ear
and whispered, &ldquo;Jacques.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man stirred and Bob placed his hand over
his mouth and at the same time whispered again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Bob, Jacques. Don&rsquo;t make a noise but get
your clothes on and meet me outside as soon as you
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob did not have long to wait, as Jacques joined
him almost as soon as he was outside the house.
Bob quickly led the way to the office and as soon as
they were inside he pulled down the shades and
lighted the lamp. He then told the Frenchman
what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think about it?&rdquo; he asked, as soon
as he had finished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;I tink it ver&rsquo; serious matter, oui,&rdquo; Jacques said
slowly shaking his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt about that,&rdquo; Bob agreed. &ldquo;But what
shall we do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tink we go ver&rsquo; queek down to dat camp, see
what we see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My idea exactly,&rdquo; Bob said as he glanced at his
watch. &ldquo;Had we better get Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tink non,&rdquo; the Frenchman answered after a
moment&rsquo;s thought. &ldquo;Tom he geet ver&rsquo; mooch excite,
oui. He mak&rsquo; too mooch noise. We go find
Jack. Me ver&rsquo; strong. You ver&rsquo; queek, oui. We
geet heem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob was not at all sure that he was doing right
in taking the Frenchman&rsquo;s advice, but he knew that
he was right in his judgment of the Irishman. As
brave as the traditional lion, Tom was very impulsive
and Bob believed that this was a time when
judgment and wits should be used rather than brute
force. So he decided not to wake the foreman.
Opening the top drawer of a desk, which stood at
one end of the room, he took out a couple of automatics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we won&rsquo;t have any use for them, but it&rsquo;s
better to be careful than sorry,&rdquo; he said, as he
handed one to the Frenchman and slipped the other
in his pocket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>As they stepped out of the office Bob noticed that
it was warmer and that the haziness had increased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t wonder if it snowed before morning,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eef she get warm enough she may snow,&rdquo;
Jacques agreed.</p>
<p>It was so dark in the woods that they were
obliged to go slowly to avoid striking the trees, and
Bob chafed at their slow progress. Every little
while they stopped to listen, but no sound save that
caused by the wind, which was gradually growing
stronger, came to their ears.</p>
<p>It was eleven o&rsquo;clock when they started, and Bob&rsquo;s
watch told him that over an hour had passed when
he almost ran into a thick clump of bushes which he
at once recognized as the spot where he and Jack
had hidden and from behind which he had shot the
jug from the hand of the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re almost there,&rdquo; he said in a low tone,
catching Jacques by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oui, I know thees place ver&rsquo; well,&rdquo; the Frenchman
whispered back, as he came to a halt. &ldquo;We
have to be ver&rsquo; careful now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The construction of Donahue&rsquo;s camp was very
similar to that which they had just left. There was
the office, the mess house, bunk house and horse
shed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>As silently as two ghosts they stole forward until
they stood only a few feet from the office, the
building which was nearest to their own camp. Not
a light was visible in any of the buildings as they
stood and eagerly gazed about them. Slowly they
crept around the small building, pausing every few
feet to listen with ear pressed close to the walls.
But no sound was to be heard, and silently they
made their way to the bunk house, where they repeated
the performance with a like result. Only
the snores and grunts of the sleeping men came
faintly to their ears. The mess house and the horse
shed were treated in like manner and with the same
result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;ve got him here anywhere they&rsquo;re keeping
mighty quiet about it,&rdquo; Bob whispered, as they
stood once more beside the office. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
have a look in here,&rdquo; he declared as he tried the
door.</p>
<p>It was locked, as he had expected it would be, but
at the back they found a small window which was
not fastened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep watch outside here, Jacques, while I
see what I can find inside,&rdquo; Bob proposed as he
carefully pushed up the window.</p>
<p>He did not know whether or not anyone slept in
the office, and at the moment, being greatly upset
over Jack&rsquo;s disappearance, he felt that he did not
care much.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>&ldquo;You better watch, let me geet in,&rdquo; Jacques whispered,
taking hold of the boy&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Mebby someone
sleep in thar. He geet you. I ver&rsquo; strong, he
no geet me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Bob returned, &ldquo;but you can
never get those shoulders of yours through that
window. It&rsquo;s too small.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob was right, although Jacques would not be
convinced until he had tried. It was a very tight
squeeze for Bob, but after much twisting and
squirming he finally got through and dropped
lightly to the floor. Throwing the light of his flash
about him, he saw that he was in a small room fitted
up much the same as his father&rsquo;s office. To the
right was a door leading into another room which,
from the size of the building, he judged must be
somewhat larger than the one he was in. The door
was closed, but opened easily as he turned the knob.
Throwing the rays of his flash ahead of him he saw
that it had been used as a sleeping room, for on the
farther side was a fair sized bed which, from the
rumpled appearance of the bedding, had been occupied
not long since.</p>
<p>Slowly, inch by inch, he pushed open the door
and stepped into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess there&rsquo;s no&mdash;&rdquo; but that was as far as he
got, for at that moment he heard a slight sound
from behind the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>He started to turn, but before he could get his
flashlight around he was struck a heavy blow on the
back of his head. He struggled to keep his feet
but, in spite of his efforts, he felt himself sinking to
the floor. A myriad of stars flashed before his eyes
for an instant, then oblivion.</p>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">JACK TAKES A FORCED WALK.</span></h2>
<p>When Jack left his brother sitting on the office
steps he fully expected to be back in a very few
minutes. Noiselessly he ran over the frozen snow
toward the side of the bunk house. As he reached
it he stopped to listen, and the slight sound of the
crackle of snow crust came to his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s out back there,&rdquo; he thought as he
stole silently toward the back, keeping close to the
side of the building. When he reached the rear
corner he paused again. The sound was now more
distinct and, as he held his breath, he could plainly
hear someone moving over the snow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>Carefully he stuck his head around the corner,
only to feel a powerful pair of arms clasp about his
neck. A muffled cry burst from his lips as he was
dragged to the snow, but before he could repeat the
cry a huge hand was pressed firmly over his mouth
effectually blocking the attempt. He struggled with
all his strength to free himself, but, soon realizing
that he was but a child in the powerful hands of the
man who was holding him, he gave it up and lay
still. He heard approaching footsteps and knew
that he was in the power of at least two men. How
many more there might be he had no way of
knowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me dat rope,&rdquo; he heard the man who was
holding him down whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you mak&rsquo; der noise and I keel you queek,&rdquo;
the man whispered in his ear as he removed his
hand from over his mouth.</p>
<p>The boy did not for a moment doubt but that he
was quite capable of carrying out the threat, so he
did as he was ordered. Quickly his hands were tied
behind his back and a large handkerchief, which
from the odor was none too clean, was bound over
his eyes. Then he was roughly jerked to his feet.</p>
<p>At that moment a window, near the farther back
corner, was pushed open. Instantly the boy was
pushed around the corner and one of his captors
again held his hand over his mouth as they crouched
on the snow. But whoever had opened the window
evidently decided that everything was all right and
what he thought he had heard was a false alarm;
for, after a moment or two, Jack heard the window
shut down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;We geet away queek now,&rdquo; one of the men
whispered. &ldquo;Dat feller mebby come out here,&rdquo; he
added, grabbing the boy by the arm.</p>
<p>Silently they stole away through the deep forest
at the back of the camp. It was too dark for rapid
traveling, but they hurried along as fast as they
could go and avoid hitting the trees.</p>
<p>Jack expected that they would head down the
lake toward the Donahue camp, as he had no idea
that the men were other than employed by Big
Ben. But, to his surprise, they soon turned north
and, after proceeding in this direction for an hour
or more, bore sharply to the east. Whither they
were bound he had not the least idea, as they were
now in a stretch of country strange to him. He
knew that there were no towns for many miles in
that direction, the section being probably the wildest
in all Maine. Not a word was spoken as they
hurried along, covering mile after mile.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s legs were beginning to ache and his breath
was coming in short pants when, suddenly, they
emerged from the dense woods onto the shore of a
lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m not mistaken this is Chesuncook Lake,&rdquo;
he thought as the men came to a halt, and for the
first time since they had started began to talk in the
French language. Jack could understand French
fairly well, but they talked so rapidly and with a
dialect which he had never heard before, that although
he was able to catch a word here and there,
he was unable to get the drift of the conversation.</p>
<p>Evidently Jack was not the only one who was
tired, for they rested for nearly a half hour before
they started again. Their way now led straight
across the lake, which was about two miles wide at
that point. On reaching the opposite shore, they
plunged again into the deep forest which lined the
bank. The men did not now seem to be in as great
a hurry as at first, and for this Jack was very thankful,
as he was very tired and felt that he would not
be able to keep up the pace they had been going
much longer.</p>
<p>It must have been nearly two hours later, and the
boy had about decided to refuse to go any farther,
when suddenly a small log cabin loomed out of the
darkness directly in front of them. Much as he
loathed the two Frenchmen, Jack could not but feel
a thrill of admiration for the way in which they
had steered a straight course through the pathless
forest when it was so dark it was impossible to see
more than a few feet ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have cats&rsquo; eyes,&rdquo; he thought as they
stopped in front of the cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>The door was not locked and, without hesitation,
one of the men pushed it open and stepped inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Geet in thar,&rdquo; the other man ordered, as he
pushed Jack ahead of him.</p>
<p>It was pitch dark in the room, but the men were
evidently familiar with the location of things, for
in a moment the one who had entered first had a
lamp lighted. For an instant the light dazzled
Jack&rsquo;s eyes so that he was obliged to close them.
When he opened them a moment later he saw that
he was in a cabin which evidently had been occupied
at some not very distant date. The room contained
but little furniture, two or three common
straight backed chairs, a rough table, and a well
battered iron stove was all, with the exception of a
couple of rude bunks built one above the other
against one side of the room. In the corner of the
room was a pile of stove wood and in another a
crude closet. The cabin held but the single room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Geet the fire goin&rsquo; Pierre, and I&rsquo;ll see what I
can find to eat,&rdquo; ordered the larger of the two men.</p>
<p>Jack sank down on one of the chairs, glad of a
chance to rest his aching legs. As the two Frenchmen
hurried about their tasks he studied them
closely. They were both large men, well above the
average in both height and weight, but the one
whom the other had called Pierre was little less
than a giant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;He must be all of six foot three,&rdquo; Jack thought
as the man straightened up after touching a match
to the kindling in the stove.</p>
<p>Both men wore short black beards and resembled
each other so closely that he decided they must be
brothers. The eyes of both were small and shaded
by shaggy brows, giving to their faces a most cruel
expression.</p>
<p>Jack was not lacking in bravery, but as he realized
that he was in the power of two men who probably
thought no more of murder than he would of
shooting a squirrel, a chill of fear stole over him,
and he breathed a silent prayer that he might escape.</p>
<p>To his surprise he saw that the closet or cupboard
was well supplied with food, judging from
the large number of cans which he could see on the
shelves.</p>
<p>Since entering the cabin the men had not paid the
slightest attention to him, and several times he wondered
if it would not be possible for him to slip out
of the door and escape them in the darkness. But
he realized that, even should he succeed in eluding
them, he would more than likely perish from cold
and hunger before he could find his way back to the
camp. And besides, he remembered that a light
snow had been falling for the past hour, and that as
soon as it was light they would easily be able to
track him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>By this time the fire was roaring up the old rusty
chimney, sending a welcome warmth through the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope they don&rsquo;t intend to starve me,&rdquo; Jack
thought as the odor of frying bacon filled the room.</p>
<p>But his heart sank as, the meal being ready, the
two men sat up at the table and started eating without
as much as a glance toward him. Jack was by
this time very hungry and his mouth watered as he
saw them gulping down huge mouthfuls of the
food. Besides bacon, he could see that they had a
good supply of eggs and crackers, as well as canned
fruit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have been expecting to come here
soon or they wouldn&rsquo;t had those eggs here,&rdquo; he
thought as he watched them.</p>
<p>But his fears in regard to starving were groundless
for, as soon as they had satisfied their appetites,
the larger man, without a word, untied his hands
and motioned toward the table, indicating that he
was welcome to what was left. Somewhat to his
surprise he found that there was enough and he
made a hearty meal, cleaning up every bit that was
left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may not be so generous next time,&rdquo; he
thought as he washed the last mouthful down with
his third dipper of coffee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>Meanwhile a large kettle had been filled with
snow and placed on the top of the stove to melt,
and as soon as he had finished the big Frenchman
in gruff tones ordered him to get busy and wash the
dishes. At first Jack was on the point of refusing,
the tone in which the order was given making his
blood boil with anger, but quickly realizing how
completely he was in their power he decided to
make the best of it and do as he was ordered.</p>
<p>The men sat at the table playing cards with a
dirty pack which they had taken from the drawer
and paid no further attention to him. Washing the
dishes was not a long task and as soon as he had
finished he sat down in the only chair unoccupied
and for a time watched the men. They were playing
for small stakes and it was evident to the boy
that the smaller man was winning. A heavy frown
settled on the larger man&rsquo;s face and Jack wondered
if the game would not end in a fight. But after
playing for an hour or more the loser threw down
the cards with an exclamation of disgust and declared
that he was tired out and was going to bed.</p>
<p>The two bunks were filled with small pine boughs
as Jack could tell by the odor which pervaded the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll have to sleep on the floor,&rdquo; he thought
as the two men threw off their heavy coats and
pulled off their moccasins.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>It was nearly five o&rsquo;clock in the morning when
they threw down their cards and started to make
preparations for bed. Jack wondered anxiously
what disposition would be made of him, but he was
not left long in doubt. He was told to keep his
seat in the chair and quickly and expertly the larger
of the men bound his hands together behind the
back of the chair. His feet were then tied firmly
to the legs of the chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I guess you stay put,&rdquo; the man grunted as
he straightened up and surveyed the job.</p>
<p>Jack had not uttered a word while he was being
tied. He knew that a plea for mercy would be a
waste of breath, so he kept quiet. After stuffing the
stove full of wood they extinguished the light and
the boy could hear them as they tumbled into the
bunks, and a few minutes later the sound of heavy
breathing told him that they were asleep.</p>
<p>For a time he strained at the rope in an effort to
free himself, but it had been tied by a man skilled in
the art, and all he accomplished was to chafe his
wrists until it seemed as though they were rubbed
raw. Realizing that he was causing himself pain
and getting no results, he soon gave up the effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Bob could do it, but I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>Then he fell to wondering what object the men
could have in bringing him there. Were they
going to hold him for ransom? Or were they
merely trying to save themselves from arrest for
attempting to burn the bunk house? These questions
and many others ran through his mind as he
sat there in the darkness listening to the heavy
breathing and snoring of the two Frenchmen.</p>
<p>How slowly the time passed. It seemed hours
before the first hint of the approaching dawn crept
in at the windows. The fire in the stove had been
out for some time and the room was beginning to
grow cold. He had tried to sleep, but his position
in the chair was too uncomfortable to permit it and
besides his arms were paining him severely due to
the strain on them.</p>
<p>Slowly the light grew stronger until finally a
beam of sunshine stole in at the east window, telling
him that the weather had cleared. He knew
that it must be nearly eight o&rsquo;clock, but the two men
gave no sign of waking. He was now thoroughly
chilled through, and his arms ached as he had never
believed it possible for arms to ache. Would they
never wake and set him free? Another hour passed
and still another. The pain was rapidly becoming
unbearable and he had about made up his mind to
shout, regardless of consequences, when he heard
one of them stir. A loud yawn followed, and a
moment later Pierre crawled out of the lower bunk.
He stretched himself and came over to where Jack
was sitting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>&ldquo;You cold?&rdquo; he asked with a broad grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather,&rdquo; Jack replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s all right. I untie you, you mak&rsquo; fire
queek,&rdquo; and a moment later the boy was beating his
arms about his body to restore the arrested circulation.</p>
<p>By the time he had the fire roaring up the chimney
the other man was up, and soon the two sat
down to breakfast. As before, Jack was forced to
wait until they had finished, then he was told that
he could go to it. He went without hesitation.
The food was good and there was plenty of it and
he made a hearty meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t intend to starve me at any rate,&rdquo; he
thought as he swallowed the last mouthful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you wash up and then you can sleep you
want to,&rdquo; Pierre growled as he got out the pack of
cards.</p>
<p>Jack made short work of the dishes, and as soon
as he had finished he tumbled into the lower
bunk and, pulling the heavy blanket over him, he
was almost immediately lost to the world and to his
troubles as well.</p>
<p>When he awoke it was dark. For a moment he
was uncertain where he was, but as memory returned
he lay quiet and listened. Not a sound
broke the deathlike stillness of the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>&ldquo;They must have gone out or I could at least
hear them breathe,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>After waiting a few minutes longer, he crept
softly from the bunk and carefully groped his way
to the stove. It was stone cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have been gone for some time,&rdquo; he
thought as he took from his pocket a small flashlight.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny they didn&rsquo;t search me to see if I
had any shooting irons,&rdquo; he whispered to himself
as he crossed the room to the closet where he found
a small tin box filled with matches. &ldquo;Guess they
were too stupid to think of it,&rdquo; he concluded, lighting
the lamp on the table.</p>
<p>He next started a fire in the stove, for the room
was already decidedly chilly, and as soon as it was
going in good shape he sat down in front of it and
started to think what his next move should be.
Had the men really left for good, or were they playing
some trick on him? were the questions which
raced through his mind. Should he leave or stay?
On the one hand he knew that he was miles from
the nearest settlement or camp, and he very much
doubted his ability to find his way through the
woods in the darkness. He well knew what it meant
to be lost in the Maine woods at that time of year.
On the other hand, he shuddered at the thought of
being tied up again to pass another night of agony.
In fact the thought was unbearable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>He got up, and, going to the door, tried to open
it, only to find that it was fastened on the outside.
An examination of the windows showed that they
were nailed down in such a way that it would be
impossible to get them open without tools.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if they thought I wouldn&rsquo;t know enough
to smash one of them if I wanted to get out,&rdquo; he
grinned as he went back to the stove. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait
long enough to get something to eat anyhow,&rdquo; he
decided, as he glanced at his watch and saw that it
was nearly half-past six.</p>
<p>In the closet he found a package of flapjack flour
and several cans of condensed milk. There was a
little water left in the pail, and diluting the milk he
soon had a batch of batter ready for the iron, and
by the time the coffee had come to a boil he had
eight richly browned cakes ready.</p>
<p>By the time he had finished his supper he had
decided on his course of action. He would smash
a window and climbing out hide in a tree from
which he could watch the cabin. If the men had
not returned by nine o&rsquo;clock he would return and
spend the night there. If on the other hand he
should see them coming back, he would wait until
they were inside and then steal away through the
woods, preferring to take his chances in the forest
rather than to be tied up again. But he had waited
too long already. He had selected a stick from the
pile in the corner and was on the point of attacking
the window, when he heard someone at the door.
A log was snatched away and the two men entered,
barely giving him time to throw the stick back on
the pile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;You geet supper ready for us ver&rsquo; queek,&rdquo; Pierre
snarled as he flung his cap on the floor and sat
down in front of the stove.</p>
<p>Knowing the folly of resisting, Jack made haste
to obey and did his best hoping that, if he pleased
them, they might not tie him up. But in this he was
doomed to disappointment for, soon after eleven
o&rsquo;clock, having tired of playing cards, the big
Frenchman tied him to the chair in much the same
way as before. But this time, remembering a trick
which Bob had taught him, he held his muscles as
tense as possible while the rope was being tied. To
his joy he found, when he relaxed, that the rope
was much looser than on the previous occasion.
He waited until heavy breathing told him that his
captors were asleep and then began to try to work
his hands free. For all of a half hour he struggled
and tears of disappointment came to his eyes as
gradually he realized that he could not do it. He
could almost do it but not quite, and finally was
forced to give up the attempt. But his position was
much more comfortable than it had been before, for
the looseness of the rope allowed him to rest his
arms by moving them slightly when they began to
ache.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>Slowly the hours dragged past until, when he
thought it must be nearly morning, he fell into a
troubled sleep.</p>
<p>The dawn was just beginning to steal in at the
window when he awoke with a start. The room
was cold and he was chilled through. His arms felt
numb and he restored the circulation by moving
them slowly up and down as far as the rope would
permit. An hour passed and then another and still
no signs of life from the sleepers. Would they
never wake and untie him?</p>
<p>He had again about reached the limit of his endurance
when, happening to glance toward the window
on the east side of the room, he saw something
which made his heart leap. A face was pressed
close against the window pane. A second glance
revealed the fact that it was the face of an Indian
and, in a moment, to his great delight, he recognized
Kernertok.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>As the eyes of the Indian rested on the boy
bound to the chair, a look first of amazement and
then of anger spread over his face. He stared at
him for a moment and then disappeared, but a
moment later Jack heard the door, which had not
been fastened, slowly pushed open. Noiselessly the
old man stole across the room and the next moment
the rope which bound his wrists was cut and his
arms were free. To free his feet was but the work
of a moment, and standing up Jack placed his finger
on his lips and pointed toward the bunks.</p>
<p>The Indian motioned for the boy to follow him,
and was starting for the door when suddenly, without
warning, Pierre sprang from his bunk and confronted
them. As the Frenchman saw the Indian
he let loose a loud cry and sprang for him. Kernertok
met him with a blow on the chin which staggered
him but did not knock him down, and in
another second they were rolling on the floor, first
one on top and then the other.</p>
<p>The cry had wakened the other man, and by the
time Pierre and Kernertok had clinched, he was out
of his bunk and rushing for Jack. But the latter, as
soon as he had seen what had happened, had stepped
quickly back to the pile of wood and picked up a
round stick about two inches in diameter and eighteen
inches long. Seeing the man coming for him,
he did not hesitate but hurled the stick with all his
might. It caught the Frenchman full on the forehead
and he went down in a heap as though he had
been shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One out,&rdquo; Jack muttered, as he turned to the
two struggling on the floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>He knew that the Indian was strong and wiry,
but feared that he would be no match for the giant
Frenchman should the latter succeed in getting a
decisive hold. He quickly picked up the stick and
was about to go to the old man&rsquo;s aid when suddenly
the latter broke away and sprang to his feet. Pierre,
with a cry of rage, followed suit. But before he
had time to spring again at the old man, an unexpected
ally entered the fight. There was a fierce
growl and a gray streak flashed through the air.
Pierre went down, thrown off his balance by the
impact. Vainly he tried with all his might to keep
the huge jaws from his throat, as man and dog
rolled over and over on the floor. But the dog had
secured a hold and was not to be shaken off. Fortunate
indeed was it for Pierre that Kernertok had
taught Sicum not to kill, else the man&rsquo;s throat
would have been torn into slits by the sharp teeth.
As it was the dog bit just hard enough to keep his
hold. But it was plenty hard enough to take all the
fight out of the Frenchman, and when, a moment
later, Kernertok dragged the dog away, he made no
attempt to rise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old Sicum,&rdquo; Jack said as he threw his
arms about the dog&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>Sicum gave vent to a low whine as if to say that
he was glad to have been of service.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>&ldquo;Git rope,&rdquo; Kernertok ordered, and in another
moment Pierre was tied hand and foot. He made
no resistance as the dog stood close by showing his
teeth.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s throat, although bleeding, was but
slightly torn, and after a hasty examination they
turned their attention to the other man who still lay
where he had fallen. He was breathing heavily
and, as Jack bent over him, he slowly opened his
eyes. He too had had all desire for fighting taken
out of him, and offered no resistance as Kernertok
bound his hands and feet.</p>
<p>A search through their pockets revealed no
weapon more formidable than a pocket knife.</p>
<p>In a few words Jack told his friend what had
happened and Kernertok in turn told how he was
returning from a trip to a town in the northern part
of the state and had just happened to glance in at
the window in passing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a mighty lucky thing for me that you
did,&rdquo; Jack declared as he finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for you tie up young white boy?&rdquo; the
Indian asked Pierre, stepping close to where he was
lying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We &rsquo;fraid he tell police we try burn bunk house,
so we tak&rsquo; him off. No know what do wid heem,&rdquo;
the man replied sulkily. &ldquo;We no mean hurt heem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought probably that was it,&rdquo; Jack declared.</p>
<p>After a short talk they decided to set the men
free and leave them there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>&ldquo;We be heap safe, they got no gun and we got
Sicum,&rdquo; the Indian declared after a thorough search
had failed to reveal any firearms in the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You follow us an&rsquo; Sicum kill you heap quick,&rdquo;
Kernertok warned them as he cut the rope which
bound the smaller Frenchman&rsquo;s hands together.</p>
<p>Leaving him to free his feet and to untie Pierre,
they started for Kernertok&rsquo;s cabin which he told
Jack was about twenty miles to the southwest.</p>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIV.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">JACQUES&rsquo; SECRET. WHAT IS IT?</span></h2>
<p>Bob slowly and painfully groped his way back to
consciousness. It seemed as though his head was
about twice its natural size and it ached with a dull
heavy pain. With the return of his senses remembrance
gradually drifted back and he slowly opened
his eyes. Now he remembered opening the door
and wondering if anyone was in the room. As he
carefully felt of the back of his head a lump nearly
the size of a hen&rsquo;s egg thoroughly convinced him
that there had been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You feel better, oui?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>He turned his head at the question and saw that
Jacques was standing by the side of the bed on
which he was lying. A small lamp, on the table at
the opposite side of the room, illuminated the surroundings
sufficiently for him to see that he was in
the room which he now remembered to have entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess so,&rdquo; he said, swinging his feet to the
floor and raising himself on one elbow. &ldquo;I think
I&rsquo;m all here, but you can never tell,&rdquo; he added, lying
back again as his head began to swim. &ldquo;But how&rsquo;d
you get in, Jacques?&rdquo; he asked feebly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heem let me in,&rdquo; the Frenchman replied, pointing
toward the foot of the bed.</p>
<p>Bob followed with his eyes and, for the first time,
saw that a man sat in a rocking chair close to the
wall of the room. A second glance convinced him
that the man was Big Ben Donahue, but he did not
look nearly as big now as usual, as he slouched in
the chair.</p>
<p>What means of persuasion the Frenchman had
used in gaining admittance to the office Bob did
not ask, and Jacques volunteered no information on
the subject.</p>
<p>As the brain cleared and the pain grew less intense,
Bob noticed the look of dejection which overspread
the man&rsquo;s face. He looked, as he afterward
told Jack, as though he had lost his last friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>&ldquo;Eef you can mak&rsquo; walk we go now,&rdquo; Jacques
said in a low tone, as he motioned for him to try
if he was strong enough to stand.</p>
<p>Bob nodded assent and the Frenchman took hold
of his arm and helped him to his feet. His head
swam, but he gritted his teeth determined not to
yield, and soon the dizziness began to pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Jack?&rdquo; he questioned, glancing toward Big
Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heem not here. We go queek. I tell story on
the way,&rdquo; Jacques whispered, taking him by the
arm and leading him from the room.</p>
<p>To Bob&rsquo;s great surprise Big Ben offered not the
slightest objection to their leaving. He had spoken
no word since Bob&rsquo;s return to consciousness. In
fact he seemed totally indifferent as to their movements.
Bob could not understand it, but having
implicit confidence in Jacques, he followed him
without a word.</p>
<p>The cold air seemed to clear the last remnant of
cobwebs from his brain and as they made their way,
slowly at first, through the deep woods, his strength
rapidly returned. His head still ached, but the pain
was slowly growing less and he did not mind it.</p>
<p>For some distance neither spoke a word, Bob
being aware that he needed to save his breath and
the Frenchman wise enough to encourage him to do
so. But when they were about half way back to
their camp, curiosity and worry got the better of
him, and he stopped and leaned against the big tree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jacques, was it Ben who hit me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oui, heem lam you one, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lam is about the word I guess,&rdquo; Bob laughed.
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t suppose I can blame him. I suppose
he took me for a burglar. But what about Jack?
You spoke back there as if you had found out something
about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oui, I tink two mans geet Jack. They try burn
bunk house. Jack heem see &rsquo;em. They scared.
Not know what do so take heem off up north. But
I tink they no hurt heem.&rdquo; Jacques hastened to
add, as an exclamation of fear burst from Bob&rsquo;s
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Jacques, how did you find out all this? I
don&rsquo;t understand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben, heem tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how in the world did you make him do it?
He isn&rsquo;t in the habit of giving away that kind of
information. And I never saw him act so funny as
he did tonight. What does it mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Jacques seemed to be lost in deep
thought, then he said slowly: &ldquo;I no can tell now.
Sometime mebby, not now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob saw that his friend had a good reason for
keeping his secret, and asked him no more questions
about the man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Jacques,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;d
tell me if you could, but what are we going to do
about Jack? He must be found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oui, we find heem. First geet home, geet rest,
then go. But,&rdquo; he added, reaching his hand around
to his hip pocket, &ldquo;I forgeet. Here what we came
for,&rdquo; and he held out a small square bottle.</p>
<p>Bob seized the bottle with a cry of joy and saw
that it was about a third filled with a fine white
powder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you find it?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heem gave it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Ben?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oui.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how in the name of&mdash;&rdquo; Bob began and then
stopped. &ldquo;All right, old man, I won&rsquo;t ask any
questions,&rdquo; he said, as he put the bottle in his pocket
and started off again.</p>
<p>He had noticed that there was no label on the
bottle and was somewhat disappointed. Still he
realized that, if the bottle contained arsenic, the fact
that it had been found in Donahue&rsquo;s possession
would be an important piece of evidence against
him.</p>
<p>It was nearly three o&rsquo;clock when they reached the
office and, in spite of Bob&rsquo;s assertion that he was all
right and wanted to start at once on the search for
Jack, the Frenchman insisted that he get a few
hours&rsquo; sleep. Seeing that he was determined, Bob
gave up the argument, knowing in his heart that the
Frenchman was right.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>&ldquo;Eet ver&rsquo; dark now. Hard to follow trail. Mak&rsquo;
bon time when light come,&rdquo; was the argument which
caused Bob to yield.</p>
<p>In the little bedroom which opened out of the
office, they threw themselves on the cots without
removing any of their clothes, and pulled a heavy
blanket over them. Bob was not long in finding out
that he was more tired than he had thought, and in
a very short time he was sound asleep.</p>
<p>It was light when Bob awoke. He glanced over
toward the other cot and seeing that it was empty
he sprang to his feet and rushed out into the office.</p>
<p>A fire was roaring in the stove before which sat
Jacques and Tom Bean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and it&rsquo;s meself thot would like ter know
what yer mane by going off in the night without
lettin&rsquo; me know about it,&rdquo; he demanded in a stern
voice; but the twinkle, which he was unable to keep
out of his eyes, told Bob that Jacques had already
explained things to him, and that he was not angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do we start?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jest as soon as we get something forninst our
belts,&rdquo; Tom replied. &ldquo;Come on wid yez. Breakfast
is ready and we&rsquo;ll be on the way in no time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>They made short work of the meal and in less
than twenty minutes they were out back of the bunk
house searching for the trail. It was hard to pick
up, as about three inches of snow had fallen during
the early morning hours, but soon Bob&rsquo;s sharp eyes
spied a broken end of a branch and a few feet away
another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;They headed north.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Traces of the trail were few and far between, and
they were often obliged to stop and hunt for some
time before they could pick up the trail again, and
any but skilled woodsmen would have been utterly
at sea. But about ten o&rsquo;clock, after they had covered
about twelve miles, they lost the trail and,
search as they would, they were unable to find it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only about three miles from here to Kernertok&rsquo;s
cabin,&rdquo; Bob said after they had been searching
for all of a quarter of an hour. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter
with going there and getting him and Sicum? I&rsquo;ll
bet he can pick up the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jacques shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dog no geet scent after snow,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know Sicum,&rdquo; Bob said. &ldquo;That dog
would smell Jack, if he knew that his life might
depend on it, through a foot of snow. What say,
Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and it&rsquo;s meself as thinks the bye&rsquo;s right.
It&rsquo;s worth a try anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>So they struck off to the east and in about three
quarters of an hour the small log cabin hove in
sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, but I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s home,&rdquo; Bob said in
a tone filled with disappointment, as he saw that no
smoke was coming from the chimney.</p>
<p>A moment later his fear was confirmed when they
found the door locked and repeated knocking
brought no response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what&rsquo;ll we do?&rdquo; he asked, leaning against
the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back and try to pick up the trail,&rdquo; Tom proposed,
but Jacques shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She no bon,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;No can find heem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; Bob asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Bout twenty mile up north ees Lake Chesuncook.
I tink mebby they mak&rsquo; for dat lake. Cabin
on shore. Mebby we find heem there. We try,
oui?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were about to adopt this plan when suddenly
Bob held up his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>All strained their ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hear nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo; Tom replied; but Jacques,
keener of ear, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s Sicum,&rdquo; Bob declared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>In a few moments the sound came again and this
time it was heard plainly by them all. Bob put his
fingers to his mouth and a shrill whistle sounded
through the still forest. The sound had hardly died
away when his quick ears caught the faint sound of
an answering whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! That&rsquo;s Jack,&rdquo; he shouted, dancing
about in his excitement.</p>
<p>Quickly he repeated the whistle and this time it
was answered much more plainly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on. Let&rsquo;s go meet them,&rdquo; he cried, and
started off on the run without waiting to see if the
others were following.</p>
<p>He met the dog first, and stopped to pet the animal,
which almost upset him as he leaped upon him
with short barks of joy.</p>
<p>He had hardly started off again before he caught
sight of Jack and in another moment the brothers
were in each other&rsquo;s arms. Kernertok was not far
behind and came in for his full share of the joyous
greeting. Then Tom and Jacques came up and the
reunion was, as Jack declared, complete.</p>
<p>They were soon in the little cabin belonging to
the Indian, and a few minutes later a fire was sending
its cheerful heat through the room. While
Kernertok hustled about preparing a meal, the
others were busy telling their stories. First Jack
gave an account of what had befallen him, and as
soon as he had finished, Bob told of the visit to the
camp of their enemy in their search for him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what happened to Big&mdash;&rdquo; Jack began, but
a warning glance from Bob caused him to stop in
the middle of the sentence, and the others did not
appear to notice the interruption.</p>
<p>In an amazingly short time the Indian had a meal
of bacon and eggs, together with hot biscuits and
coffee on the table, and it was a very merry party
that sat down and gave thanks to the Giver of all
good things.</p>
<p>Soon after three o&rsquo;clock they said goodbye to
Kernertok and started for camp, reaching there just
in time for supper. Jacques had declared that he
must be off early the following morning for the far
North, and although the boys coaxed him to stay
another day, he stuck to his purpose.</p>
<p>They were up early the next morning to see him
off, and the first sign of the coming day was just
showing in the east as the big Frenchman swung
his long lash with a crack like a pistol shot over
the heads of his huskies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Au revoir,&rdquo; he shouted, as he fell in behind the
sled. &ldquo;I see you in der spring, oui?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet. Goodbye, Goodbye,&rdquo; both boys called
after him, and the next moment the vast forest had
swallowed him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>&ldquo;There goes a friend worth having,&rdquo; Bob declared,
as they turned back to the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One in a thousand,&rdquo; Jack added, pushing open
the door.</p>
<p>A few moments later, when they were by themselves
in the office, Tom having gone to the horse
shed to give some orders to Sam, Jack said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Bob, what was the idea in hushing me up
so mysteriously yesterday, when I started to ask
you about Ben Donahue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be jiggered if I know what it&rsquo;s all about,&rdquo;
Bob replied slowly. &ldquo;I never was more surprised
in my life than I was when I saw Ben sitting there
in that chair as meek as Moses and then some. He
didn&rsquo;t so much as open his mouth and acted for all
the world like a whipped puppy. I asked Jacques
what it all meant, but he was about as communicative
about it as a clam, and I didn&rsquo;t really find out a
thing. He said mebby he could tell me sometime.
Do you know what I think? For some reason Ben
is afraid of him. I don&rsquo;t mean physically, but
Jacques has got something on him sure as you&rsquo;re
alive, and it must be something pretty serious to
make him come across with that bottle of arsenic;
that is, if that&rsquo;s what it contains, and we&rsquo;ll know in
a minute if it is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>He drew the bottle from his pocket and, removing
the stopper, dropped a little of the white
powder on the hot stove. Instantly a white cloud
arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the stuff all right,&rdquo; he declared, as the well-known
odor of garlic filled his nostrils.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with it?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it down home with us and give it to
father,&rdquo; replied Bob as he put the bottle back in his
pocket. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether he&rsquo;ll want to make
a charge against Ben or not. You know he&rsquo;s apt
to be pretty easy when it comes to a thing like that,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; Jack interrupted, &ldquo;I guess Ben&rsquo;ll
think twice before he tries any more of his tricks
to keep back father&rsquo;s work now that he knows we
have that bottle. Do you know, Bob,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;when Jacques got that bottle he saved the
day for father, so far as that contract is concerned.
At least that&rsquo;s my opinion. The way things were
going it was only a question of time when Ben
would have hit on something which would have
spilled the beans in good shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right about that,&rdquo; Bob agreed.
&ldquo;He came pretty near doing it when he sent those
fellows up to set fire to the bunk house. If they
had succeeded it would have set us back a week or
more. Father&rsquo;s got you to thank for that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s face flushed at the praise and he tried to
disclaim the credit, but Bob insisted that it was due
him and finally he let it go at that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think father&rsquo;ll have any trouble in proving
his title to the tract?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see why he should,&rdquo; Bob replied. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
got the deed and it ought to be clear sailing I
should think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s been a bully vacation,&rdquo; Jack declared
as he got up from his chair. &ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;ve got
to go tomorrow, but I sure do hate to leave the
woods. But of course we want to spend a few
days with the folks before we go back to the
Fortress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we do. But come on and make it snappy,&rdquo;
Bob cried as he pulled on his mittens. &ldquo;I feel like
the fellow who put the pep in pepper this morning,
and I want one more whack at those big spruces
before we leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they spent the day with the crew, adding log
after log to those already piled up on the shore of
the lake, waiting for the breaking up of the ice in
the spring.</p>
<p>The evening they spent with the men in the bunk
house, telling stories and singing songs to the accompaniment
of Bob&rsquo;s guitar.</p>
<p>All too soon bedtime came, and they climbed into
their bunks for their last sleep in the big woods
until spring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>Tom was to drive them down to Greenville in
time to catch the noon train for the south, and after
breakfast all the men gathered about them to say
goodbye, and tears shone in more than one pair of
eyes as they shook hands with each man in turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mak&rsquo; der new man of me. De bon Dieu
bless you,&rdquo; said big Jean Larue, the tears streaming
down his cheeks, as he gripped Bob&rsquo;s hand as
though he never wanted to let it go.</p>
<p>They reached Greenville just in time to get a bite
to eat at the hotel before train time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back in time for the river drive,&rdquo; Bob
shouted to Tom, as he waved his hand from the
rear platform as the train pulled out from the station.</p>
<p>The next volume in this series will be &ldquo;<span class="sc">The

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
